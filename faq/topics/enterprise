* EnterpriseServices

<p>Q: Does Novell have intentions on providing EnterpriseServices?

	<p>At this point it seems like EnterpriseServices on the
	Windows world will remain only a backwards-compatible API, and
	developers will be encouraged to move to the new Indigo
	platform.

	<p>So at this point, it is not likely that we will spend any
	cycles supporting EnterpriseServices on Mono.

<p>Q: What about the future?

	<p>One possible implementation path would be to implement
	first Indigo, or something equivalent to Indigo, and then
	build on top of this the API exposed by EnterpriseServices. 
		
<p>Q: Is anyone working on EnterpriseServices?

	<p>At various times various volunteers have tried to implement
	the EnterpriseServices API, but so far nobody has completed
	such a task.

<p>Q: I really need something like EnterpriseServices, what can I do?

	<p>You could either join an existing effort to implement
	EnterpriseServices, or you might want to look at different
	solutions available.

	<p>You might also want to look at third party products on this
	space:

		distributed platform, although it might not do everything you
		want.
	</ul>
