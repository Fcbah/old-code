* JIT engine

<p>What platforms are currently supported by the JIT?

	<p>The JIT currently supports the following platforms:

	<p>32 bit platforms:

	<ul>
		<li>x86 
		<li>SPARC
		<li>PowerPC
		<li>S390
	</ul>

	<p>64 bit platforms:
	<ul>
		<li>SPARC v9.
		<li>x86-64.
	</ul>

	<p>Mono comes with an interpreter as well that works on the
	above platforms and in addition on the StrongARM and HPPA
	architectures.  The interpreter is not as fast as the JIT
	engine. 

<p>Will you support dynamic recompilation of "hot" methods?

	<p>Although this is not currently on the plans, the various
	bits that would be necessary to support dynamic recompilation
	of hot methods is being worked on:

	<ul>
		<li>A new method-call trampoline system that will
		allow us to replace the method on the fly.

		<li>A non-intrusive runtime profiler (available <a
		href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-devel-list/2004-August/007566.html">here</a>)
		that will allow the identification of hot methods with
		minimal overhead.
	</ul>
