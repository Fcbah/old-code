* Web Services Enhancements

<p>Where can I get Web Services Enhancements (WSE) for Mono?

	<p>A: WSE is not available for Mono, and currently we do not
	have plans on implementing the WSE.

	<p>There are two implementations of WSE today: WSE1 and WSE2,
	they have different APIs and they are regarded as stop-gap
	solutions until Indigo comes out.

	<p>In addition, there is also rumor that a WSE3 implementation
	would come out, and it is not clear whether the API will be
	compatible or not.  

	<p>At this point the Mono team is not currently looking at
	implementing any of these APIs, but we would welcome any
	contributions in this area.
