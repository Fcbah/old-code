	* Fix pdb2mdb to work with new Mono.CompilerServices.SymbolWriter.

	* RemotingContract/Contract.cs: Launch now returns a
	IServerProcess interface, we use this to communicate with the
	process directly.

	* Mono.VisualStudio.Debugger/Port.cs: Track the IServerProcess to
	Process mapping.

	* Mono.VisualStudio.Debugger/PendingBreakpoint.cs: Small style
	changes. 

	* Server: Add support for -map to remap filenames on the server to
	filenames on the client (this is a quick hack, will go away
	later).

	* Server: drop the solutions from Server, as they require the Unix
	assemblies for the debugger.

	* Add .csproj files for launcher and DebuggerServer to work on Windows (for now).

	* Refactor the PortSupplier and split out the Port class.   The
	Port will represent a remote host, the PortSupplier should be able
	to launch new ports in new hosts.

	Rewrite the code to use the documented public COM interfaces to
	register nodes to hook things as documented.

	Still, no progress made in notifying the debugger of a program
	creation event.   I believe this is the next step:

	* Copied the infrastructure for sendings AD7 Events, most stuff
	are stubs now.

	* RegisterDebugger: Add the Mono-based PortSupplier.
	
	* RemotingContract: Return the pid.

	* Fix addin on Win64. Use uri.LocalPath to fix handling of paths with spaces. Absolute path used %20.

	* Figured how to register the Debug Engine in the registry, we now
	hit the first NotImplementedException inside VisualStudio.

	Add docs.

2008-06-06  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	Hook up PDB to MDB conversion to the project.

	Try to launch the debugger.

	Add new Debug Engine (currently does not work, we need to get the
	beast to register with COM, and I have no idea how to do it).
