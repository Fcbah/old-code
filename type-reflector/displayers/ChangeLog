	* ITypeDisplayer.cs: Add InitializeInterface() method.  This is used to
	  split up Type Displayer execution into five phases:
	  - Create the displayer
	  - Set the Properties (Formatter, Finder, etc.)
	  - Initialize the interface
	  - Add Types
	  - Run
	  The primary reason for adding the initialization step was so that GUI
	  code could assume that the properties had been set and were valid
	  before making use of them, which the Gtk# front-end needed to do.
	* TypeDisplayer.cs: Default implementation of InitializeInterface(); add a
	  Clear() function which is useful for creating new, empty, windows.

	* ChangeLog: New file.  I can't believe I haven't needed it yet...
	* ConsoleTypeDisplayer.cs: Cope with changes in ITypeDisplayer
	* ITypeDisplayer.cs: Assemblies are required now, not types.  It's more
	  sensible this way.  AddType() now has `curType' and `totalTypes'
	  parameters, which allows GUI displayers to display progress bars.
	* TypeDisplayer.cs: Cope with changes in ITypeDisplayer
