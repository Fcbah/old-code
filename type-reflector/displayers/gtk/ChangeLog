	* GtkTypeDisplayer.cs, AppWindowManager: Change namespace to `...gtk' 
	  from `...Gtk' (note: it's now fully lowercase).  Why?  To work around C# 
	  "issue" where it prefers names from the current (nested) namespace over 
	  the global namespace.  So it would look for 
	  Mono.TypeReflector.Displayers.Gtk.Window instead of using Gtk.Window 
	  --> BAD.  The name change fixes this.
	  Thanks to Alexmipego for noticing this.
	* AppWindowManager.cs: Directly set the MenuItem child text instead of
	  iterating over children.  The loop shouldn't be necessary.
	* GtkTypeDisplayer.cs: Destroy the main window when closing.

2004-10-09  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>
	* GtkTypeDisplayer.cs: Add file drag-and-drop support.  You can now DnD
	  files from nautilus onto Type Reflector to open & inspect assemblies.

2004-06-02  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>
	* AppWindowManager.cs: Update to Gtk# Beta 2 API

2004-03-07  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>
	* AppWindowManager.cs: Update to gtk-sharp 0.17 API
	* GtkTypeDisplayer.cs: Update to gtk-sharp 0.17 API

2003-11-27  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>
	* GtkTypeDisplayer.cs: Turn on icon display by default.  Change "options"
	  TreeView so that we better organize the options, between binding & members.

2003-11-23  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>
	* GtkTypeDisplayer.cs: Compilation fix for Gtk# 0.14.

2003-10-25  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>
	* AppWindowManager.cs: New class; "manages" application top-level windows.
	  More accuratey, it manages the "Window" menu, so that it's in sync across
	  all of the created windows.
	* GtkTypeDisplayer.cs: Factor out the window management code into
	  AppWindowManager.cs.

2003-10-12  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>
	* GtkTypeDisplayer.cs: Gtk# works now, so we can make use of it...
	  - Make the "Reflector" menu bold
	  - Make the "Window" menu update properly, complete with window title names
	  - CVS Gtk# compilation fixes
	  - Some cleanup
	* type-reflector.gade: I read parts of the Mac OS X HIG; some updates
	  - Preferences should be Ctrl+,
	  - The "short" app name should be referred to in menu items, About, etc.
	  - Add shortcut for Help (F1)

2003-09-28  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>
	* GtkTypeDisplayer.cs:  Lots of changes
	  - Initial attempt at adding icons to the TreeView; currently disabled
	    due to runtime error message (needs more debugging); see SHOW_ICONS
	  - Menu layout: We're going Mac OS X style!
	  - More functionality: we can create empty windows, show all windows, 
	    hide windows, etc...
	  - Replace Console.WriteLine with Trace.WriteLineIf.
	  - Rename Glade callback functions so that they're not so tied to the
	    menu name.  Instead of "on_file_quit_activate", it's "app_quit".
	* type-reflector.glade: Layout changes:
	  - Use Mac OS X style menu bar
	  - Get rid of stupid spacing on left; it didn't look good or consistent

2003-09-09  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>
	* GtkTypeDisplayer.cs: Compilation fix.  Gtk.Window conflicts with
	  Gnome.Window.

2003-08-10  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>
	* GtkTypeDisplayer.cs: Allow Formatters menu to track updates in Formatters
	  treeview, and vice versa.

2003-07-03  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>
	* GtkTypeDisplayer.cs: Lots more updates.  It's for lots of prototyping...
	  - Prepare for the future of selecting multiple files at once
	  - Complete GUI revamp (new side bar for Formatters, general Finder
	    options, showing/hiding of GUI pieces, name changes, AddType progress...
	    Try it, you'll like it.  If the TreeView would ever deal with lots of
	    Reflection, that is.  Otherwise, it's horribly broken.  But it has been
	    since June 26, so it isn't any worse...
	* type-reflector.glade: name changes, new widgets, new layout...

2003-06-26  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>
	* GtkTypeDisplayer.cs: Lots 'o' Updates
		- Clean up OpenFileSelection.
		- Use the new Managed TreeView functionality.
		- Allow dynamnic language selection (the View->Formatter menu works now!).
		- Provide GUI error messages (still needs some work, though).
		- Fix the Help->About dialog.
	* type-reflector.glade: Fix the View->Formatter menu, add Accelerator for
	  Help->About, remove unused AboutWindow.

2003-04-14  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>
	* GtkTypeDisplayer.cs: Minor build fixes for latest Gtk#.

2003-02-19  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>
	* GtkTypeDisplayer.cs: Add support for dynamic node expansion, as seen in
	  displayers/swf.  For example, if you run "type-displayer -A
	  type-displayer.exe -Sv ." (run Type Displayer on itself, showing
	  everything verbosely), you can keep expanding rows to view detailed
	  parameter information of methods.

2003-01-14  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>
	* GtkTypeDisplayer.cs: This was moved into /displayers/gtk, so the glade
	  file paths need to be updated.

2003-01-10  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>
	* GtkTypeDisplayer.cs:
	  - If the current window isn't displaying an assembly, open the assembly 
	    within the current window.
	  - Use [GladeWidget] attributes to get items from the .glade file.

2003-01-10  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>
	* GtkTypeDisplayer.cs: Moved to Mono.TypeReflector.Displayers.Gtk.

2003-01-09  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>
	* GtkTypeDisplayer.cs: Change name of OpenFileDialog class to
	  OpenFileSelection.  OpenFileDialog is a System.Windows.Forms class, so
	  this was causing compiler errors when attempting to compile both Gtk# and
	  System.Windows.Forms support.

2002-12-31  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>
  * GtkTypeDisplayer.cs: Remove some debugging messages.

2002-12-31  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>
	* ChangeLog: Added
	* GtkTypeDisplayer.cs: Gtk# front-end for reflection information
	* type-reflector.glade: Glade description for Gtk# front-end
	* type-reflector.gladep: Glade Project file

# vim: noexpandtab
