A better way of displaying Custom Attributes needs to be used, so that the
actual properties/field values of the custom attribute is displayed.

A better way of specifying Assemblies on the command line.  It would be useful
to say ``-a foo.dll -a bar.dll -a baz.dll'' instead of 
``-a foo.dll:bar.dll:baz.dll''.  The framework for such parsing is described
in ``ProgramOptions.cs''.

Any of the TODO items listed in ``ProgramOptions.cs''.

For Gtk#:
  - Make View->Formatter be synchronized with the Formatter sidebar.  Requires
    some way of getting information about the selected item.  (There doesn't
    appear to be a simple way to find the Menu Item Label text from a
    RadioMenuItem. :-(
