This is the initial version of the Glade-3 add-in, which integrates Glade-3
into MonoDevelop. To test the add-in you need the following:

* Make sure you have the latest Mono and GTK# version.
* Get Glade-3 from http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/glade-3/2.90/glade-3-2.90.0.tar.gz
* Apply the patch glade3.patch, which is located in this directory.
* Compile and install Glade-3
* Get the gladeui-sharp module from the Mono repository.
* Compile and install gladeui-sharp.
* Run autogen.sh in the MonoDevelop directory setting the --enable-glade option.
* Compile MonoDevelop.

You are done! To use the integrated editor, create a new Glade project and
add a Window or Dialog (using the Add File option, and selection the Glade
section in the new file dialog). You should also enable the Glade Project View,
the Glade Palette and the Glade Properties editor in the View menu.
