2006-09-01  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* mbuild.cs: Create the toplevel dist directory before attempting to
	dist. Oops.

2006-08-08  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* InstallerServiceNotify.cs: Track that IInstallerServiceNotify is now
	in Monkeywrench.

2006-07-30  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* mbuild.cs (Launch): Better double-init error message.

2006-07-19  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* mbuild.cs (NotifyRecompile): Hook up to the new OnRecompile event here.

2006-07-18  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* mbuild.cs (Launch): Make the printed text after initialization even more
	helpful, because I feel that it will be very useful for first-timers.

2006-07-12  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* mbuild.cs (DoOperation): Track the new operation model. Get a list of
	tags and filter it instead of putting all the logic in WrenchProject.Operate.
	(*): Also add more command-line arg validation: complain on more incompatible
	flags.

2006-07-07  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* mbuild.cs (profile_graph): New command-line option that triggers
	use of the GraphStateProfiler class.

2006-07-06  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* mbuild.cs: Track LoggingData -> ActionLog rename.

2006-07-06  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* mbuild.cs (SetMajorMode): Quick function to try and signal an 
	error if conflicting 'major modes' (eg, install and distribute) are
	specified.
	(ShowLog): Add a --last mode that causes the most recent build 
	actions to be printed out from the now-saved build log.

	* BuildLoggerProxy.cs: Track IWarningLogger.

	* WarningLoggerProxy.cs: Track IWarningLogger.

2006-07-05  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* mbuild.cs: For now, make the XML graph indented by default.

2006-07-03  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* mbuild.cs: Uncomment everything; WrenchProject works again.

2006-06-28  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* mbuild.cs: Comment out large portions until Monkeywrench settles
	down. Now just creates the ProjectManager and loads stuff. Also change the 
	initial log loading a bit with the related changes.

2006-06-23  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* mbuild.cs (Launch): Catch exceptions during build so we can clean up.

2006-06-17  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* mbuild.cs: Reindent a bit.
	(MBuildClient): Add a '--force' option to force a build.
	(Launch): Add a message after init telling what to do to
	recheck the prereqs, because I keep on rerunning mbuild with
	the -i flag.
	
2005-10-10  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* mbuild.cs: Handle Result -> BuiltItem in BuildServices.

2005-09-01  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* mbuild.cs: Ifdef out some using statements too.

2005-09-01  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* mbuild.cs: Start work on a separate install client. The idea is that
	we spawn off a separate privileged process to do the installs, while we
	build and write logs as the owner of .monkeywrench.log. This way the
	.monkeywrench files don't get taken over by root and if we need to build
	anything it won't be root-owned. Unfortunately, you can't setuid() a Mono
	process because the Wapi stuff won't be able to read its files and will
	panic. So need another solution, probably involving a C helper program.
	Yes, I know the TcpChannel stuff is insecure too, I'll copy Martin's
	debugger code once the other stuff is ironed out.

2005-08-29  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* mbuild.cs (DoInitMode): if ~/.mbuild-init.config exists, import it as
	an XML file.
	(ImportXml): Don't necessarily exit after doing an import.
	(DoXmlExportMode): If no filename given, export to stdout

2005-07-14  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* mbuild.cs (ImportXml): Don't need to pass the IResultTypeLookup anymore.

2005-05-19  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* mbuild.cs (DescribeInstall): Track changes to compat finder.

2005-03-05  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* mbuild.cs (DescribeInstall): Let the compat finder report the error if necessary.
	Pass it a logger, set location.

2005-01-19  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* mbuild.cs (BeforeCleanEvent): Print a marker when cleaning.

2004-12-06  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* mbuild.cs (RunQuery): The logical improvement: also let the user specify the basis
	on the command line, ie 'mbuild --get-builddir /Mono.Build/Mono.Build.RuleLib'; keep
	the --get-top{src,build}dir options.

2004-12-06  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* mbuild.cs (RunQuery): New function. Allows you to query useful build variables
	from the command line: mbuild --get-DIR, where DIR is one of topsrcdir, topbuilddir,
	or srcdir.

2004-09-29  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* mbuild.cs (DoDescribeMode): New command-line option, --describe-install
	(DescribeInstall): New operation, describes what installation steps would
	be run. Fair amount of duplication with WrenchOperations.Install.

2004-09-27  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* mbuild.cs: Helpful param names from Mono.GetOptions. Cute feature.

2004-09-26  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* mbuild.cs: Rework to use BuildServices for operations. Use
	WrenchOperations members for the common operations instead of
	using the WrenchProject helper functions. Hook up to WrenchOperation
	events instead of WrenchProject events.

2004-09-15  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* mbuild/mbuild.cs: Clarify the need-init printout a bit.
