	* Buildfile: Use fewer explicit targets with our better grammar.

2006-06-16  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* mb-gtkconfig.in: Add -a argument to exec. New file, calls
	gtk-config not trying to run it from the build dir, since it
	will always be called in a build dir.
	* mbuild.in: Same.
	* tmpl.in: Same.

	* Buildfile: Rearrange to have most scripts be generated
	from a common template, with a wrapper that executes the
	local copy of the prog if we're in builddir.

2005-07-14  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* Buildfile (mb-import): Comment out mb-import since that's
	unfinished at the moment.

2004-08-30  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* mb-bundledoc: Oops, create this.

	* Buildfile (mb-bd2xhtml): And fix this : bd2, not mb2

2004-08-30  Peter Williams  <peter@newton.cx>

	* Buildfile: Install all the wrappers; if we're using the Buildfile,
	then everything is built.

	* mb-bd2xhtml, mb-bundlegen, mbuild, mb-gtkconfig: Reference binaries
	in {libdir}/{compat-name} instead of {bindir}. Need to generate these
	from .in files for Makefile installation ... sigh.

	* mb-bd2xhtml: Add this. Start ChangeLog.
