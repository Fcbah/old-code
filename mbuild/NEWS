0.0.3.1
====================

* Massive internal cleanups. No one will appreciate this because they
  never saw the previous messy code, but it's much better. Trust me.

* Added mb-bundlegen, a tool for generation MBuild bundles using
  CodeDom. Very very very useful for writing bundle code.

* Added mb-gtkconfig, a simple graphical build configurator. It
  generates UIs on the fly, so it's ugly, but it's good enough.

* Wrote API documentation of some of Mono.Build.dll and began the
  MBuild Handbook.

* Versioned bundle loading from the GAC. Pure sweetness.

* Support for installing. So so so so clever. Too clever for my own
  good. But I don't care.

* Robust error and warning reporting system.

* Reworked ArgCollector to be much more satisfactory.

* Tagging is much more widely used.

* Beginnings of bundle documentation system, with mb-bundledoc and
  mb-bd2xhtml.

* I think MBuild is now realistically usable for C# projects.

0.0.2
====================

* Begin Mono.Build.RuleLib, a library of useful functions
  for rules (autoconf-y stuff.) So far we have some structure
  for invoking other programs: BinaryInfo, ClrInfo, Launcher
  class. There are also classes for stream processing a la
  grep, sed, etc; not used or very tested yet but they will be
  a basis for these common operations. Also a class for finding
  tools in the environment (probably needs a lot of fixing).

* Added Tools.Jay bundle

* Moved System.CLR.CSharp to Languages.CSharp

* Moved System.CLR to System.Clr

* Added MakeFile rule in System bundle (not recommended, I'm
  not sure of the wisdom of this design.)

* Fleshed out logging infrastructure

* Also began error checking / reporting infrastructure

* Futzed around with ArgCollectors: can set default values for
  arguments now. Still not satisfactory though.

* Fixed it so that changed ConstantTargets show up (because their
  rule fingerprint is now the static result's fingerprint. Deviously
  clever if I do say so myself.)

* First stab at tagging targets

* Added --below, --debug-logs, --all arguments.

* Added '+foo' syntax to build targets matching tag 'foo'.

* Add 'load FILE inside BASIS' syntax in Buildfiles

* A few optimizations.

0.0.1
====================

* Initial public release. Spotty functionality.
