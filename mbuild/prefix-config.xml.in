<!-- We use this file to import Autoconf's idea of the prefix
     into MBuild, avoiding the annoying prompt of a bare-bones
     'mbuild -C'. This is suggested in the instructions printed
     after the user runs a 'make install'.

     This file also serves as a cute demo of how the -import-xml
     and -export-xml commands are useful.
