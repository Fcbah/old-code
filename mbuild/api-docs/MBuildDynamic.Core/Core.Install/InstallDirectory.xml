                <summary>A string representing a directory to install into.</summary>

                <remarks>
		   <p>An InstallDirectory is actually a subclass of <gr href="T:Mono.Build.MBString">MBString</gr>, 
		   not of
		   <gr href="T:Mono.Build.MBDirectory">MBDirectory</gr>. This is because MBDirectories are
		   supposed to exist before the build runs, while
		   an installation directory might only be created when the install happens.
