<h1>Mono 1.0 Features</h1>

<br/>

<h2>CLI runtime engine.</h2>

  <p>
    The Mono runtime engine implements the ECMA Common Language
    Infrastructure specification to the best of our knowledge and is
    able to execute code produced by the Microsoft .NET Framework. 
  </p>

  <p>
    The Mono runtime engine is available for various architectures and
    operating systems: x86, x86-64, PowerPC, SPARC, S390, StrongARM,
    HPPA on Linux, Windows, HP-UX, Solaris, MacOS and BSD operating systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition an advanced native optimizing compiler is available
    for x86, SPARC, s390 and PowerPC available in both an
    ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation mode to reduce startup time and
    take advantage of all available optimizations and a Just-in-Time
    (JIT) compilation mode.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Mono runtime engine uses the Boehm conservative Garbage
    Collector (bundled with the release).
  </p>

  <h3>Known Issues</h3>

  <p>

    Code Access Security (CAS) is not supported in Mono 1.0
  </p>
    
<h2>Java runtime engine.</h2>

  <p>
    The Mono 1.0 release bundles the <a
    href="http://www.ikvm.net">IKVM</a> Java virtual machine and the
    tools required to get Java and .NET interoperability.
  </p>

  <h3>Known Issues</h3>

  <p>
    The Java functionality is limited by the features supported by the
    <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/classpath.html">GNU
    Classpath</a> libraries. 
  </p>

<h2>Class Libraries.</h2>

  <p>
    The class libraries as shipped with Mono implement the .NET 1.1
    profile.  Binaries produced with Mono will run only with the .NET
    1.1 framework or later versions on Windows systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    These are the libraries that make up the Mono 1.0 release:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>mscorlib.dll</li>
    <li>System.dll</li>
    <li>System.Data.dll</li>

    <li>System.DirectoryServices.dll</li>

  </ul>

  <p>
    Please read the section on <a href="#issues">known issues</a> with
    the above libraries for details.
  </p>

<h2>The Gtk# 1.0 GUI programming toolkit.</h2>

  <p>
    Gtk# is a cross platform GUI programming toolkit available for
    Linux, Windows and MacOS X systems and is the recommended platform
    for doing desktop application development at Novell.
  </p>

  <p>
    Gtk# provides access to any of the Mono supported languages to the
    the libraries that make up the GNOME 2.2 platform, and it is fully
    is compatible with new versions of GNOME.
  </p>

  <ul>

    <li>art-sharp.dll: LibArt 2D graphics engine.</li>
    <li>atk-sharp.dll: Accessibility toolkit.</li>
    <li>gdk-sharp.dll: Low-level windowing interface.</li>
    <li>glade-sharp.dll: Glade GUI designer support.</li>
    <li>glib-sharp.dll: GLib integration.</li>
    <li>gtk-sharp.dll: The GUI toolkit.</li>

    <li>pango-sharp.dll: Unicode text rendering.</li>
    <li>rsvg-sharp.dll: SVG rendering library.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    All of the above are available for Mono and the Microsoft .NET
    Framework to develop cross platform applications.  In addition on
    Linux and MacOS X the following are also available:
  </p>

  <ul>

    <li>gconf-sharp.dll: Gnome Configuration integration.</li>
    <li>gnome-sharp.dll: GNOME UI libraries.</li>
    <li>gecko-sharp.dll: Mozilla integration.</li>
    <li>vte-sharp.dll: Terminal Emulator Widget.</li>
    <li>gtkhtml-sharp.dll: The lightweight HTML rendering engine</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Work is underway to make these APIs available to Windows .NET
    developers as well.
  </p>

  <h3>Known Issues: MacOS X</h3>

  <h4>Gtk# applications fail to start with `Cannot open font file for font Verdana 12'</h4>

  <p>This is only an issue if you are executing GTK+
  applications remotely from MacOS X.  To solve this, use the
  following workaround:</p>

  
  <xmp class="shell">
    $ export GDK_USE_XFT=0
  </xmp>
  

   <h2>Mono and Novell specific Libraries.</h2>

   <p>

     with a short description of their functionality.  Refer to the
     documentation for more information on them:

     components with Mono 1.0 as they are useful to developers:
   </p>

   <ul>

     <li>ByteFX.Data.dll: MySQL client access library (LGPL)</li>
     <li>SharpZipLib.dll: Zip, Tar, Bzip compression library.</li>

   <h2>GNU Classpath for the CLI.</h2>

   <p>
     We bundle a version of the GNU Classpath with this release of
     Mono to support the execution of Java applications.   The support
     of Java is limited in what is supported by GNU Classpath. 
   </p>

   <h2>C# 1.0 Compiler</h2>

   <p>

     The compiler implements the ECMA C# 1.0 implementation with
     support for CLS compliance compilation.  In addition it has
     support for implicit method group conversions and
     iterators.   These features are turned on by default. 
   </p>

   <p>
     Although there are known parsing errors and compilation errors for some
     extreme corner cases, we are not aware of the compiler generating
     incorrect code at the time of the release.
   </p>

   <h2>IL assembler/disassembler</h2>

   <ul>
     <li>The Assembler does not support v-table fixups, local thread storage nor unmanaged exports.
     <li>The disasembler (monodis) is not complete and will be replaced with a command-line compatible one in the future (ildasm).
   </ul>

   
<h2>.NET 1.1 profile known issues</h2>

  <p>
    This is not a comprehensive list, nor does it list all of the
    differences with the .NET Framework, refer to the documentation. 
  </p>

  <h3>Known Issues: General</h3>

  <p>
    The Code Access Security (CAS) APIs are available, but they are
    non-functional in the above libraries.
  </p>

  <p>
    COM support has been stubbed out, and will throw
    `NotImplementedExceptions' if used. 
  </p>

  <h3>IBM DB2 and OracleClient</h3>

  <p>
    These are both managed wrappers for proprietary client libraries,
    so their availability is limited to the platforms where their
    client libraries are distributed.
  </p>

  <h3>System.Data</h3>
  <p>
    Currently we support TDS protocol version 7.0, some features in
    the Framework require version 8.0.
  </p>

  <h3>System.Drawing</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>

      Metafiles and Printing are not supported.
    </li>
    <li>
      Pen does not support dash caps, different end caps and compound array.
    </li>
    <li>
      CustomLineCap and AdjustableArrowCap are not
      supported.
    </li>

    <li>
      In TextureBrush, ImageAttributes are not supported.
    </li>

    <li>
      TextureBrush and LinearGradientBrush have
      problems in handling transformation matrix because
      of a known Cairo bug. Cairo does not tile a pattern
      well, if it is transformed at the same time.
    </li>

    <li>
      PathGradientBrush support is not complete.
    </li>

  <h3>Known Issues: System.Web</h3>
  <p>
    The behavior of Trace.axd in Mono 1.0 does not match the .NET
    behavior and we recommend that you do not store passwords on
    Trace.axd files.   If this feature is important to you please see <a
