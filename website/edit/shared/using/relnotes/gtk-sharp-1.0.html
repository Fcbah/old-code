<h1>Gtk# 1.0: Mono's GUI toolkit</h1>
<br/>

<p>

   <a href="http://gtk-sharp.sf.net">Gtk#</a> is a Framwork for Mono
   and the .NET Framework to develop of GUI applications with Mono and
   .NET on a variety of platforms: from Linux to Windows to the MacOS
   X and embedded devices with a frame buffer.

</p>

<p>
  Applications produced with Mono and Gtk# can be used interchangeably
  between all of the supported platforms without having to recompile
  your code.  
</p>
   
<h3>Gtk# features:</h3>

<blockquote>
<dl>
  <dt>
    <b>Dynamic layout.</b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Applications developed with Gtk# adjust automatically when
    translated into different languages as well as adjusting
    automatically to environment changes like fonts without forcing
    the developer to redesign his application.<p/>
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <b>Code and Design separation.</b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Users of Gtk# keep the design of an application separate from the
    code: allowing user interface artists and usability experts to
    design the application and developers to wire the user interface
    to the actual business logic.

    <br/>Gtk# can automatically wire up interfaces generated with Glade
    to your code.<p/>
  </dd>
  <dd>

  <dt>
    <b>Printing </b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Access to the GNOME printing API takes care of previewing,
    spooling and configuring printers for users and provides a
    high-level Postscript-like programming interface.<p/>
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <b>Mozilla Integration.</b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Developers can create solutions with the Mozilla browser, for more
   information see the <a
   href="http://www.go-mono.com/docs/monodoc.ashx?link=root%3a%2fclasslib-gecko">API docs.</a>
  </dd>
   
  <dt>
    <b>Accessibility</b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Through the use of Sun's Atk, developers can create fully
    accessibly applications compliant with <a
    href="http://www.section508.gov/">Section 508</a>.  An application can
    be used with such tools as screen readers, magnifiers, and alternative input devices.
    <p/>
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <b>Unencumbered Licensing</b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Gtk# is free software. Applications developed with Gtk# come with no strings attached:
    you can develop any kind of application: commercial or free
    without requiring any extra fees.<p/>
  <p/>
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <b>Advanced Graphics.</b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Gtk# can be used in combination with the <a
    href="http://www.cairographics.org">Cairo Graphics Library</a> (using the
    Mono.Cairo library) or
    System.Drawing to render advanced graphics and develop custom
    widget with a PDF-like imaging model.<p/>
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <b>Multi-language.</b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Gtk# can be used from any language supported by the Mono
    platform.  The most popular choices are C# and Java.<p/>
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <b>International.</b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Gtk# uses <a href="http://www.pango.org">Pango</a> for rendering
    international text on the screen, so Gtk# is ready for
    international applications.<p/>
  </dd>

  <dt>
    <b>Searchable Documentation.</b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    The Monodoc documentation system ships with a documentation
    browser that can be navigated per class, or using a searchable index.<p/>
  </dd>
</ul>

<h3>Known Issues</h3>

<p>
  Gtk# binds the GNOME 2.2 developer platform as this is the most
  wildly deployed version. Upcoming releases will address this
  problem as newer versions of GNOME become available.
</p>

<p>
  The GConf, GnomeUI GtkHTML APIs are not supported on Windows.
</p>
