<h1>Mono 1.0 Preview Features</h1>
<br/>

<h2>Preview Introduction</h2>

  <p> 
    
    Some features of the Mono 1.2 release are available as a preview,
    but they are not fully supported at this time.  They are made
    available to developers to get a glimpse of what is coming, but
    there is little or no support available at this time for any of
    these technologies: these components are neither complete and did
    not meet the release criteria for Mono 1.0.
  </p>
    
<h3>Generics</h3>

  <p> A compiler implementing C# Generics is available as the command
    line `gmcs', but this is not yet a complete compiler for generics,
    and it is known to contain some bugs.  Some Generics classes have
    been implemented, but there are many known missing features.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Mono Virtual machine already has support for generics, so
    there is no need to use a different one.  Only install the preview
    packages to get a glimpe of it, the new packages can be installed
    in parallel with the Mono 1.0 release and they will not disrupt
    its operation.
  </p>


<h3>Mono Basic compiler.</h3>

  <p>
    The Mono Basic compiler is still a work in progress effort to
    implement the VB.NET language.   It is capable of compiling some
    applications, it is useful for small programs only at this point.
  </p>

<h3>Windows.Forms</h3>

  <p>
    The Windows.Forms implementation at this point is not API
    complete.  It can run small applications, but it fails with larger
    applications that excercise the API more.  Windows.Forms support
    is scheduled for release by the end of the year.
  </p>

  <p>
    To use Windows.Forms you need to install Wine and the Winelib
    package, available as part of this release, but as preview
    components. 
  </p>

<h3>Assembly List</h3>

  <p>
    The following assemblies are sometimes required as a dependency
    to pull a few routines from, but they are not supported.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>System.ServiceProcess.dll</li>
    <li>System.EnterpriseServices.dll</li>
    <li>System.Management.dll</li>
    <li>System.Messaging.dll</li>
    <li>System.Design.dll</li>
    <li>Accessibility.dll</li>
    <li>System.Configuration.Install.dll</li>
  </ul>
