	<p>The db4objects database system is now available for Mono,
	for more information see <a
	href="http://www.mono-project.com/contributing/db4o.html">db4o</a>
	documentation on the Mono site.

	<p> db4o is a non-intrusive persistence system that stores any
	complex object with one single line of code. The class schema
	of your application classes is analysed and adjusted in real
	time when objects are stored. Querying functionality is
	provided through Query-By-Example and with the
	S.O.D.A. querying API. High performance is achieved with
	indexed fields and by reducing database-file-internal
	redirections to the absolute minimum. db4o features ACID
	transactions, fast embedded single-user mode and
	multi-transactional Client/Server access, locally and through
	TCP.

	<p><b>Installers:</b> Installers are now available to install
	the latest versions of Mono with a single click from our <a
	href="http://www.mono-project.com/downloads/">download</a>
	page.  Thanks to Daniel from <a

	<p>Mono 1.1.4 and 1.0.6 have been released.

	<p>As of this version, Mono 1.1.4 has received more testing
	and more scrutiny that Mono 1.0.6, and we strongly recommend
	that people switch to the 1.1.4 release.

	<p>We will continue to support 1.0.x for those who can not do
	a larger change, but keep in mind that 1.1.4 at this point is
	stabler, has many less bugs, faster, better tested and more
	complete than the 1.0.6 series.

	<p>There are significant changes: make sure you read the
	release notes as there are many exiting features in monodoc,
	xsp, apache support, xml, relaxng, the C# compiler, the VM and
	more.

	<p>Detailed release notes:

	<p><b>FireBird:</b> Carlos Guzm√°n's <a
	href="http://firebird.sourceforge.net/">Firebird database</a>
	provider has been checked into CVS and will be part of the
	next release of Mono 1.1.xx.

	<p>Firebird SQL can be used either in server/client mode, or
	it can be embedded into your application to simplify
	configuration and deployment of smaller applications.  Both
	modes are supported by Carlos' provider.

	<p><b>Windows.Forms:</b> Work continues on the new Mono
	Windows.Forms implementation.  A <a

	started specifically to track its progress.  Status of the
	development of various components is also <a
