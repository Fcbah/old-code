				<h3><a href='http://usefulinc.com/edd/blog/2004/6/2#14:24'>Edd Dumbill: Happy Zero Day!</a></h3>
				<div class='blogentry'>
					<p>I use my email inbox as a to-do list.  While an email's in there, it means
action is required.  Today, for the first time in over a year, I reached
the zero-email point. Time to celebrate!</p>
<p><strong>Mono</strong></p>
<p>There are some other reasons for celebration this week, too.  One of these is
the <a href="http://go-mono.com/archive/beta2/beta2.html">release</a> of the second beta of
<a href="http://go-mono.com/">Mono</a>.  This is the last beta before the final 1.0 release
at the end of this month.  Happily, Niel Bornstein and I have enough time
to check beta 2 out against the examples in <a href="http://usefulinc.com/edd/books/mono-notebook">our
book</a>.  We're expecting the book
to be out mid-July, a few weeks after Mono 1.0.</p>
<p><strong>Debian</strong></p>
<p>Another happy event is that GNOME 2.6 made it into Debian unstable.  My
contribution to this is the maintenance of the packages for the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/epiphany/">Epiphany web
browser</a>.   I also uploaded the
<a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/epiphany/extensions.html">Epiphany extensions</a>
package today.</p>
<p><strong>GNOME Bluetooth</strong></p>
<p>I've been making time to work on <em>libbtctl</em>, the underlying GObject-based
library that's part of my GNOME Bluetooth project.  For a long time I've
been needing to rewrite the object-exchange (OBEX) layer to integrate well
with the GLib event loop, and not die horribly.  The example OBEX application
shipped with the <em>openobex</em> project has one or two unfortunate bugs in it,
which I'd previously cut-and-pasted into my own code.  Through some heavy-duty
reading of the <em>libopenobex</em> source code, I now feel more confident about
the OBEX support.</p>
<p>In parallel with the C code, I'm maintaining Python and Mono bindings, so
Bluetooth functionality should be available to these environments at the time
of release.  These languages make exchanging files with devices like
cellphones a matter of two or three lines of code.</p>
<p>I've been moving more functionality that was previously in the applications
alone into the libraries.  I'm now far enough on with the underlying libraries
that I can bring the application layer up to date, in particular applications
like <a href="http://usefulinc.com/software/phonemgr">Phone Manager</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Linux Unwired</strong></p>
<p>Still on the Bluetooth front, Marcel Holtmann released version 2.7 of the BlueZ
libraries, as I <a href="http://usefulinc.com/edd/blog/contents/2004/05/26-bluez/read">mentioned earlier</a>.  This
makes some parts of Linux Unwired to be inaccurate, so I
published errata on <a href="http://usefulinc.com/edd/books/linux-unwired">my Linux Unwired page</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Laptop</strong></p>
<p>I foolishly caused my Sony TR1-MP laptop to need to be reinstalled the other
day.  It was one of those errors which made me decide to reinstall, and then
realise later I didn't need to.  Too late by then, of course.</p>
<p>I tried out Fedora Core 2, after a night of downloading ISOs.  However, after
a morning of frustration, I went back to using Debian unstable.  The main
reason for this is that the process by which new kernels are compiled was
unfamiliar to me.  Simply compiling a known-good kernel, tweaking the grub
configuration and installing wasn't good enough, FC2 managed to oops it on
boot.  The kernel as distributed takes way too long to boot for my laptop
(alas, suspend not yet working) so recompiling was a must.</p>
<p>Something seems strange to me with the font handling on FC2.  Bitstream Vera
Mono has the right stalk of the "m" cut off in gnome-terminal, and the
configuration of freetype gave significantly different letter shapes to those I
get from Debian.</p>
<p>It's not all bad, and it's largely a matter of familiarity, I guess. FC2 did
have a nice installer. </p>
<p>The other upside to this tale was that I discovered a <a href="http://nomadic.null.li/intel/1280patch.c">neat program</a> that allows me to use the
1280x768 resolution of my laptop without a <a href="http://www.xig.com/">proprietary X server</a>.   Though the XiG server used to work just fine,
my DFSG-purity is now restored.</p>
<p>What I really need for my laptop is Debian on a 6-month release cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Conferences</strong></p>
<p>I booked my accommodation for this summer's season of conferences:
<a href="http://www.guadec.org">GUADEC</a>, <a href="http://www.desktopcon.org/2004/">Desktop Developers' Conference</a>, <a href="http://www.linuxsymposium.org/2004/">OLS</a>, and
<a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/oscon/">OSCON</a>.
Phew.</p>

				<h3><a href='http://codeblogs.ximian.com/blogs/tberman/archives/000257.html'>Todd Berman: 0.4 release, beta 2, mmm</a></h3>
				<div class='blogentry'>
					<p>Pushed 0.4, get more info <a href="http://www.monodevelop.com/release_notes/0.4.html">here</a></p>

<p>This matches up with the beta2 release, and other fun stuff. It is really much much nicer than anything else we have put out. This is actually useful, and usable software. Of course, there are lots of bugs, so file them if you dont want to see them again in 0.next.</p>

<p>I have been way too busy with real life things and real work recently, so 0.4 doenst contain everything I want, but its still a solid release. Unfortunately, 0.next wont contain everything I want either (as slipping now, means slipping later), but what can one do.</p>

<p>As I mentioned in my last entry, <a href="http://off.net/~shaver/diary/">Mike Shaver</a> somehow got me installing thunderbird. I have since decided he did this totally for his own evil purposes, as I have since filed two patches for issues I couldn't deal with, and am inspecting some others. Working with code outside of mono/monodevelop is always an adventure, especially when you work with something as <i>unusual</i> as xul+xbl+js. Very interesting.</p>

<p>As someone who i've recently become friends with might say 'Fascinating in fact. Very fascinating.'</p>

				<div class='blogentry'>
					<p>Just released version 0.8 "Wrightsville Beach" of the Mono Debugger :-)



<p>You can get it <a href="http://primates.ximian.com/~martin/debugger/mono-debugger-0.8.tar.gz">here</a>.  Unfortunately, a last minute breakage slipped into Mono's beta2, so it's unusable for the debugger.  You need to use the latest CVS version.



<p>This week, I'm also starting to write some documentation for the <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/monkeyguide/html/en/tools/debugger.html">MonkeyGuide</a>.

				<div class='blogentry'>
					<p>Since last week am spending somewhat sick days and couldn't hack nicely :( Moreover my house is on repairment and became not good place to hack (noise, closed window without air conditioner in my room...). Am mostly out recent days.</p>

<p><h3>major DataRow performance fix</h3></p>

<p>I have been helped my DataSet hack by julia who has been trying so practical example code with megs of data. Yes, it was not good to trace the bug location, but very good at testing performance ;-)</p>

<p>After the dataset fixes, I believed that I improved DataSet.ReadXml() performance (to compare the results, I ran my "detacheable" ReadXml() implementation under MS.NET). So when I saw the performance results on ReadXml() after some stopper ReadXmlSchema() fixes, I could not believe what is happening. Our ReadXml() was > 1000x slower than MS.NET(!). So I started profile, and noticed that DataRow.ctor() was 1000x slower. </p>

<p>I fixed it immediately, but unfortunately I could not notice that before our beta2 release (unless there would be a critical package problem and we have to re-collect sources from cvs :-). So if you want to know what happens in Mono 1.0 after beta2, install <a href="http://primates.ximian.com/~atsushi/System.Data.dll">this assembly</a>. I might upload a patch for this fix here after beta2 release.</p>

<p><h3>anglia test collection</h3></p>

<p>Recently (well, in fact nearly two weeks ago ;) Jeff Rafter <a href="http://relaxng.org/pipermail/relaxng-user/2004-May/000514.html">announced </a> his new "anglia" RELAX NG compact syntax test collection (he is implementing his own compact syntax parser). It is cool and was so useful for me and I could fix really problematic part of my parser. Bugs still remain, but I could easily add a simple standalone test for anglia. Am very appliciated.</p>

				<div class='blogentry'>
					<p>With Mono Beta2 I was able to get <a
	href="http://www.monodevelop.org">MonoDevelop</a> to work on
	my Mac.  

	<p>You must get Mono Beta 2 (0.95), gtksourceview (0.7 Fink),
	Mozilla (Fink), GtkSourceView# (0.3), Gecko# 0.4 and
	MonoDevelop 0.4.

<p><center><a href="http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/pic.php?name=monodevelop-macos.png&caption=MonoDevelop on MacOS X"><img border=0 src="http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel//pictures/small-monodevelop-macos.png"></a><p>MonoDevelop on MacOS X</center></p>
	<p>There are a few Linux-isms in there that you must fix, a
	quick workaround is to add the following to your
	$prefix/etc/mono/config file:

<xmp class="shell">
	<dllmap dll="libgtk-win32-2.0-0.dll" target="libgtk-x11-2.0.0.dylib"/>
	<dllmap dll="gnomevfs-2" target="libgnomevfs-2.dylib"/>
	<dllmap dll="gdldock" target="libgdldock.dylib"/>
	<dllmap dll="libMonoPosixHelper" target="libMonoPosixHelper.dylib"/>
	<dllmap dll="libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0" target="libgtk-x11-2.0.0.dylib"/>
	<dllmap dll="libglib-2.0-0.dll" target="libglib-2.0.0.dylib"/>

</xmp>

	<p>Then you must edit
	$prefix/lib/monodevelop/bin/gdl-sharp.config, this is what I
	have:

<xmp class="shell">
	<configuration>
	  <dllmap dll="libglib-2.0-0.dll" target="libglib-2.0.0.dylib"/>
	  <dllmap dll="libgobject-2.0-0.dll" target="libgobject-2.0.so.0"/>
	  <dllmap dll="libatk-1.0-0.dll" target="libatk-1.0.so.0"/>
	  <dllmap dll="libgtk-win32-2.0-0.dll" target="libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0"/>
	</configuration>

</xmp>

	<p>You still need to use GDK_USE_XFT=0 from the command line.

	<p>Of course, the real fix is to get MonoDevelop to generate
	those files (and fix the few incorrect hardcoded references to
	x11), but I will let Todd do that.

					<p>ATI released <a href="http://www.ati.com/support/products/workstation/fireglx2/linux/fireglx2linuxdrivers.html?type=linux&prodType=firegl&prod=fireLinBedriver&submit.x=12&submit.y=2">version 3.9.0 of their fglrx linux driver</a>
today.  As expected, it is <a href="http://www.rage3d.com/board/showthread.php?s=&threadid=33760878">a total disaster</a>.  However,
assuming you can get their kernel module to not Oops your kernel, it
has potential to be more stable than their previous releases.  At
the very least, it's been running on my desktop for the past ~3 hours
without issue, though others have lockups after 15 minutes.</p>

<p>I really wonder whether components of their driver really contain
significant IP that needs to be protected from their competition, or
whether they only think they do.  Certainly there are bits in their
OpenGL implementation that they would prefer to not reveal; however,
if they were to provide hardware documentation, I'm sure that the Mesa
crew would love nothing more than to have a fully hardware accelerated
platform on top of which to implement Mesa OpenGL.  Unfortunately,
it probably won't happen -- if it did, we wouldn't have
<a href="http://www.beyond3d.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=12486">hijinks such
as these</a> to keep us awake at night, because what the hardware does
would be quite clear.</p>

<p>Edit: okay, the above may have been slightly over the top; I'm just
quite frustrated with the state of Linux support of ATI's relatively
recent hardware (I won't even bring up X800, just talking about r300 here!).
ATI has been very open in the past, and there is good open-source hardware
accelerated 3D available for r200-class hardware.  I've also yet to run
into showstopper issues with the 3.9.0 drivers, though I haven't really
ran many OpenGL apps.  Some abysmal performance with 2D that seems to
not occur for everyone (i.e. some people running the drivers get 600k+
x11perf -aa10text, others, like me, get 57k.), but I don't really notice
it in practice.  I'll have to play with the 3D bits; the lack of
GL_shading_language_100 is disappointing, but at least vp/fp are there.</p>

				<div class='blogentry'>
					<p>Long time, no bloggin for me. I have been a bit busy getting a lot of stuff in the real world in order, and devoting the rest of my time to mono (what little ive had).</p>

<p><a href="http://primates.ximian.com/~lluis/blog/">Lluis</a> (WebServices, Remoting mono hacker) checked in an amazing patch. Right now 0.4 is going to be a seriously kickass release. Our memory requirements are lower than they have ever been in the history of MonoDevelop. The startup time is faster, everything is better. I gush when I speak of this patch, it is almost disturbing how happy it makes me.</p>

<p>Tonight, I have been playing with thunderbird a bit. It is a very amazing product considering its immaturity. Of course, I have a handful of issues with it, but all in all, I am very impressed (and yes, I know a lot of the core code is old and not immature, but I'm speaking mostly of the UI code). Tomorrow I might blog a bit about a couple of the issues I have with the UI and maybe I will even file them on their bugzilla. ;)</p>

<p>Finally, the gac is something that people seem to be starting to play with in the last week or so. I can <b>not</b> stress enough that just because your assembly ends in .dll means it needs to go into the gac. In fact, 99.9% of the time, it doesnt have to, and shouldnt.</p>

<p>Here is a good rule of thumb. Does anyone else use your assembly? if no, dont gac, use the applications AppBase, if yes, gac, but think *really* hard before doing so.</p>

<p>and im going to stop ranting about it a bit here ;)</p>

				<div class='blogentry'>
					<p>Its been a while since my last blog-entry, 
but now it is time to blog again.

<p>I have translated 
<a href="http://www.monodevelop.com">MonoDevelop</a>
into Danish. It was pretty easy, and I encourage you 
to translate MonoDevelop into your native language.
<br>To do so, get a 
<a href="http://devservices.go-mono.com/MonoDevelop">snapshot</a> 
or the latest SVN of MonoDevelop and look in 
po/README for more information on how to get going with your translation.

<P>During my translation of MonoDevelop I found out that
<a href="http://usefulinc.com/edd/blog">Edd Dumbill</a>
created a C#
<a href="http://usefulinc.com/edd/blog/contents/2004/05/Catalog.cs">I18N Catalog</a>,
which work by P/Invoking Gettext.

<p>I have replaced Gettext# in 
<a href="http://mwh.sysrq.dk/programs/programs.phtml">Jumpnbumpmenu</a>
with Edd's Catalog because of Gettext#'s downsides.
<br>Gettext# does not work with Mono Beta 1 
(should work with latest Mono CVS though),
it is only available in the very latest version of Gettext 
and it does not allow the use of po files.

<p>Catalog in Jumpnbumpmenu is used like this:
<xmp class=code-xml>
Catalog.Init ("jumpnbumpmenu", null);
...
Catalog.GetString (" does not exist."))
...
</xmp>
<ul>
 <li>First the initialization is done telling gettext the name of the translation file.
 <li>Next, strings which should be translated are used as arguments for Catalog.GetString()
</ul>

<p>Lately I have been reading two good computer books, which I would like to recommend.
<ul>
 <li>Firewalls and Internet Security SE by Cheswick et al.
 <li>Linux Assembly Language Programming by Neveln.

Well, obviously my little writings don't have the readership that the blogs of Miguel, Havoc or Seth have. I wanted to weigh in though on one issue for those who are not familiar with the open source politics. There are definetely valid discussions worth having about Mono, Redhat and Novell. However let's not forget something. Novell is pushing Mono, it might end up being an important differentiator in their linux offering in the future. Sun is pushing Java on the desktop, though after using Java for eight years, I can't fathom why that would be good. But they're riding the J2EE success wave into the desktop and that's a valid marketing sleigh of hands.
<p>
Redhat, Seth and Havoc can't push straight Sun Java not does it want to push Mono. There are corporate interests at hand here. Somewhat in the disguise of working for the open source best interests, blogs are being written to attack Mono. Let's read them for what they are -->

					<p>I've put together <a href="http://slightly.off.net/rc-fc2/rcfc2/fedora-2-i386">Red Carpet packages for Fedora Core 2</a> (only rug/rcd, for now); give them
a try, and let me know if you have any problems.  I also changed some
defaults annoyances; these packages won't attempt to listen on a network
port unless explicitly told to, and they'll refresh channel data every 6
hours instead of the default 2.</p>

<p><i>Edit:</i> If you're upgrading from an existing rcd install, the easiest
thing to do is to <b>rm -f /var/lib/rcd/services.xml</b>.  Alternatively,
you can <b>rug service-add http://slightly.off.net/rc-fc2</b>.  Both will
get you a new set of FC2 channels (which just point to various apt repos).</p>

<p>For the last few days I've also been working on getting a ADO.NET data-bound Gtk TreeModel
implemented in C# on top of ManagedTreeModel.  It's coming along quite nicely;
you can't edit yet, but the core bits seem to work.  Here's an example:</p>

<pre class="code-csharp">
using System; using System.Data; using Npgsql; using Gtk;

class SqlExample {
  static void Main () {
    NpgsqlConnection dbc = new NpgsqlConnection(dbstring);
    NpgsqlDataAdapter adapter = new NpgsqlDataAdapter ("select * from music", dbc);
    DataSet ds = new DataSet();
    adapter.Fill (ds);

    Application.Init();
    Window w = new Window ("Music Database");
    w.SetDefaultSize (480, 100);
    ScrolledWindow sw = new ScrolledWindow ();

    DataTableModel dm = new DataTableModel (ds.Tables[0]);
    TreeView tv = new Gtk.TreeView (dm);
    tv.AppendColumn ("Artist", new Gtk.CellRendererText(), "text", 0);
    tv.AppendColumn ("Album", new Gtk.CellRendererText(), "text", 1);
    tv.AppendColumn ("Title", new Gtk.CellRendererText(), "text", 2);
    sw.Add (tv);
    w.Add (sw);
    w.ShowAll ();

    Application.Run ();

<p>Other than that, some of the photography
equipment for this summer's project arrived today, so I put everything
together and testing things out, and it should work out well.. hopefully
there will be lots of photos to come after I get back.</p>

<p>I also spent a bit of time tracking down some annoying mono value type
marshalling bugs; various bits of marshalling structs to/from unmanaged
code are slightly broken, but I think I have an idea of what's going on.</p>

				<h3><a href='http://usefulinc.com/edd/blog/2004/5/26#16:41'>Edd Dumbill: Debian Bluetooth update</a></h3>
				<div class='blogentry'>
					<p>I've made some experimental packages for the latest release of
<a href="http://www.bluez.org/">BlueZ</a>, version 2.7.</p>
<p>This version continues the trend set by 2.6 of merging separate
packages into one.  Now bluez-pan is incorporated into bluez-utils,
as well as the bluez-sdp merge done in 2.6.  I've reflected this
change in the Debian package.  All you now need to install to get
a functional Bluetooth setup is the bluez-utils package.</p>
<p>Support for Bluetooth mice and keyboards comes in the form of the <code>hidd</code>
daemon.  This only works in conjunction with a patch to the Linux 2.6.6 kernel
available from <a href="http://www.bluez.org/patches.html">the Bluez web site</a>.  I'm
editing this entry from an Apple Bluetooth keyboard connected to my Linux
machine.</p>
<p>One other change in 2.7 is the migration of the BlueZ CUPS backend
into the bluez-utils source package.  I've preferred to have this
generate an extra package, bluez-cups, which you can install to
enable Bluetooth-connected printers.  Additionally, I've enabled
the D-BUS support of hcid in the build, which will enable BlueZ
to play a whole lot nicer over multiple desktop systems.</p>
<p>So, a summary of changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>bluez-pan, bluez-sdp now merged into bluez-utils</li>
<li>bluez-cups is a new package for CUPS Bluetooth printing</li>
<li>hcid now supports D-BUS enabled PIN helpers like bluez-pin</li>
<li>Bluetooth mice and keyboards supported with kernel patch</li>

</ul>
<p>Because of the new package, it might be a week or so before this
gets into Debian experimental.  You can also download them from
the <a href="http://bluez.sf.net/download/debian/">BlueZ Debian repository</a>.
I'd welcome any and all feedback on these packages.</p>

					<h4>Neuros: The Price of Freedom</h4>

<p>Well, I got the Neuros a few days ago.  It certainly plays oggs and mp3s
quite well; the sound quality is excellent.  The MyFi built-in FM transmitter
also worked nicely, much better than any FM dongle that I've used.  However,
I will be returning it and purchasing an iPod (which, I suppose, I should have
done from the start).</p>

<p>The Neuros has a number of problems, most of which
stem from the software on the device itself.  It has locked up/crashed on me
at least a dozen times over the weekend (a problem that a few others have
said never happens to them, though they were running a slightly older
firmware version than what was shipped to me on the device).  It has locked
up when touching some vorbis files encoded with a very old encoder (vorbis
0.7).  The interface on the device itself is a small disaster as well;
with 40GB worth of music, it's hard to navigate using a directional joystick,
though there are some shortcuts that make it easier.</p>

<p>But perhaps the most compelling reason is that <a href="http://ipodlinux.sf.net/">Linux can run on the iPod</a>.  This means that at some point, it will
be possible to play back vorbis on iPods; it will be possible to add things
to the iPod's interface, or change how things work, or whatever.  Granted,
the Neuros folks are helping support free software by including Vorbis
playback.  However, I want a device that I know will be rock solid and that
I won't ever have to think about whether it will crash or not.  The iPod,
with Apple's MP3/AAC-only firmware, will do that.  Linux on the iPod will
hopefully get to that point as well, on a very sexy hardware package.</p>

<h4>Managed TreeModel</h4>

<p>I sent some patches to the gtk-sharp mailing list that allow one to
implement a GtkTreeModel entirely in managed code.  This is pretty cool --
doing so is much easier than doing it in C, and it opens the door to some
neat stuff, such as a ADO.NET DataView data-bound model, which I'm working on
now.  This is one of the things that I've wished gtk-sharp had for a while,
as it'll make taking advantage of the rich data manipulation tools of
System.Data much easier.</p>

				<h3><a href='http://primates.ximian.com/~lluis/blog/archives/000447.html'>Lluis Sanchez : New Thread.Abort implementation</a></h3>
				<div class='blogentry'>
					<p>Miguel oficially anounced that we have a new implementation for Thread.Abort. This has been until now the source of many unstabilities in the runtime, specially in ASP.NET and in applications that use backgorund threads or the thread pool.</p>

<p>The old implementation was using a signal to notify the thread that it had to be aborted. Upon receiving the signal, the thread would raise the ThreadAbortExcetpion, no matter which code it was running. The problem is that if the thread is running unmanaged code, it may be holding unmanaged locks, or it may leave some internal data structures in an undetermined state.</p>

<p>In the new implementation, we still use a signal to tell the thread that it has to be aborted, but it is handled in a different way:</p>

<p><ul><li>When a thread needs to be aborted, its state is set to AbortRequested and the thread is signaled using the abort signal.</li><li>If the thread is running managed code when it gets the signal, the Abort exception will be thrown without any delay.</li><li>If the thread is running unmanaged code, a special flag is set in the MonoThread that specifies that the thread needs to be interrupted. When the thread returns to managed code, that flag is automatically checked and the thread is aborted if needed.</li></ul></p>

<p>Unmanaged methods that can block need a special handling. The most evident ones are the wait methods: WaitForSingleObject, WaitForMultipleObjects and Sleep. Although they run in unmanaged code they need to be abortable at any moment. What I've done is to implement the "Ex" version of those methods, which have an additional parameter "alertable" to specify if the wait can be canceled. The method QueueUserAPC can be used to cancel the wait, I've added this method to the io-layer. </p>

<p>The runtime has to check the result those methods and make sure that interruptions are correctly handled. Wait methods will return WAIT_IO_COMPLETION if they are externally interrumped. Other io-layer methods such as _wapi_accept will return a generic error.</p>

<p>There is also a basic support of Thread.Abort for Windows. In Windows, instead of using a signal to tell the thread that it has to be interrupted, it uses QueueUserAPC to enqueue a callback that will do the interruption check. However, since the APC queue is only checked in the wait methods, there is no guarantee that the thread will ever stop. This may happen if the thread never performs a managed-unmanaged transition after the abort is requested. This needs more work.</p>

<p>I've also reused all this infrastructure to implement Thread.Suspend and Thread.Stop (no, the Stop method does not exist in the Thread class, but it is used by the runtime to stop background threads. It does basically the same as Thread.Abort but without throwing the exception).</p>

<p>The problem with Thread.Suspend is that if the thread is suspended in unmanaged code holding an unmanaged lock, it will probably deadlock the whole runtime. To make sure this doesn't happen, the thread must be suspended when running managed code. the idea is to request an interruption of the thread using a signal (in fact the same signal used for thread.abort), and when it enters in a state in which it can be safely interrumped, just suspend it. However, it still doesn't work because it relies on SuspendThread from io-layer to finally suspend the thread, and this method is not working properly since it has deadlock problems with the garbage collector. The easy solution is to not use SuspendThread, and use instead a semaphore controlled at runtime level. Will work on this soon. Of course, if the thread holds managed locks it can still cause a deadlock, but this is a problem of the application, not the runtime.</p>

<h3>Nemerle, C# and Anonymous Methods.</h3>

	<p>Spent some time this afternoon playing with <a
	href="http://www.nemerle.org">Nemerle</a> and their latest <a
	href="http://nemerle.org/mailman/pipermail/devel-en/2004-April/000033.html">release</a>.

	<p>Specially nice since now MonoDevelop supports Nemerle in
	the built-in editor.

	<p>My main problem is that I find it hard to think in any
	other way which is not the standard programming that I have
	grown up to do, maybe I need a hobby programming task to do.
	It will have to wait until we release Mono 1.0, right now
	things are busy.   

	<p>My personal wish: I would like a C#-like scripting language
	myself.  Sprinkle a few perlisms, rubyisms and pythonisms in
	there.  Drop the class carcass.

	<p>A small patch I have been playing with in my copious spare
	time is one to turn all unresolved method calls in C# to a
	dynamic code translation.  So basically:

<pre class="code-csharp">

  object a = new XmlDocument ();
  a.Load ("/tmp/a.xml");
</pre>

	<p>ie, notice that the type of the variable is `o'.  The
	downside: the runtime has to transform the incoming parameters
	to something that matches the call, you loose the compiler
	safety net, and its slower.  But at least you can prototype
	quickly ;-)

	<p>I do not like the current implementation of anonymous
	methods, it really does not work in the presence of nested
	anonymous methods, so I have gone back to the drawing board
	and have now a new design for this internal chunk of the
	compiler that am a lot happier with.  As soon as the beast
	compiles, I will upload a new patch.

	<p>The C# compiler also gained recently a new flag: -pkg:NAME
	which integrates pkg-config directly into the compiler.  We
	are making the world a better place, one command line option a
	day.

<h3>Managed code is fast</h3>

	<p>Andreas, Ben and Paolo <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-devel-list/2004-May/005843.html">
	have</a> <a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-devel-list/2004-May/005844.html">been</a>
	<a
	href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-devel-list/2004-May/005858.html">discussing</a>
	moving existing code that we implement in C to the managed
	world, as our JIT is in some cases as good as the C compiler
	and the transition from managed to unmanaged is too costly: we
	can now move more code into the managed world.

	<p>The old gcc exceptions mechanism that the Mono JIT used for
	a long time to speedup calls into the unmanaged world is gone.
	It was too much of a support nightmare (gcc and libc would
	often be out of sync, rendering the optimization useless), and
	instead Zoltan has cooked up some ways to improve the
	transition cost on x86 and SPARC.

<h3>Ports</h3>

	<p>The PowerPC port got a big boost today with various fixes
	checked in from Paolo; Neale continues to update the S390 port
	and Zoltan has checked in some fixes to support Linux on the
	SPARC (in addition to Solaris).

	<p>We still need to support the Itanium and the x86-64 CPUs
	(if you have a good recommendation about a book on these
	platform, please mail me) as they are important platforms for
	SUSE.

<h3>Thread.Abort and File locking</h3>

	<p><a href="http://primates.ximian.com/~lluis/blog/">Lluis</a>
	completed this week the Thread.Abort implementation for Mono.
	Our old implementation had various issues if we aborted thread
	while we were in unmanaged code (since there was no way to
	clean things up).  Lluis' new implementation now shuts down
	things properly.

	<p>Now this might seem like a problem that few people would
	run into, but the reality is that it happened a lot with
	people using ThreadPools, ASP.NET or WebRequests since all of
	them triggered a call to Thread.Abort, and the side effects
	were ugly: from assertions in the runtime, to hangs at program exit.

	<p>This fixes the last major reliability blocker problem we
	had for Mono 1.0.

	<p>Dick in the meantime implemented the locking functionality
	for Files, a feature that some people needed and that was not
	really there before.

<h3>Xslt Joshua and documentation</h3>

	<p>Joshua has checked in the tools to produce HTML out of
	Monodoc.  Real men use Monodoc, but if you feel like giving up
	on your manhood, now you can browse uncompressed,
	not-as-beautiful, not-indexed classes ;-)

<h3>Marek. Martin.  Raja</h3>

	<p>They are rapidly closing the last pending bugs in the MCS
	compiler, none of them are crucial, but we want to ship with
	as few bugs as possible in the compiler.  At this point, we
	are no longer accepting large changes to the compiler (which
	also means that Anonymous Methods will just not make it into
	the 1.0 release, too bad, they were too cute).
