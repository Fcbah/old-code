			<h1>What is Mono?</h1>
			<p>Mono is an open source implementation of the Microsoft .NET Framework, based on the ECMA standards [link to ECMA Standards).</p>
			<p>Mono is positioned to become the leading choice for development of Linux* applications. Sponsored by Novell and led by Miguel de Icaza, the Mono project has an active and enthusiastic contributing community. Mono includes both developer tools and the infrastructure needed to run .NET client and server applications.</p>
			<p>Mono includes a compiler for the C# language, an ECMA-compatible runtime engine (the Common Language Runtime, or CLR),and class libraries. The libraries include both Microsoft .NET and third party class libraries, and the runtime can be embedded into applications for simplified packaging and shipping. In addition, the Mono project offers an IDE, debugger, and documentation browser.</p>


			<p>The Mono project is an open source effort sponsored by	<a href="http://novell.com">Novell</a> to create a free implementation of the .NET Development Framework.</p>
			<p>Mono includes <a href="c-sharp.html">a compiler</a> for the C# language, a <a href="/using/runtime.html">Common Language Runtime</a> (CLR) for the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) and a set of <a href="class-library.html">class libraries</a>.  The runtime can be <a href="/using/embedded-api.html">embedded</a> into your application.  It implements both <a href="/contributing/ado-net.html">ADO.NET</a> and <a href="asp-net.html">ASP.NET</a>.</p>

			<h2>May 2nd, 2004: mDnsResponder.Net;  Global Assembly Cache.</h2>
			<p>Brady Anderson has released the first version of his <a href="http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfmod/project/?mdnsresponder">multicast DNS responder</a> written in C# for the Mono and .NET platforms.  This is the foundation for implementing rendezvous-like functionality in your applications.</p>
			<p>The tree has started to stabilize after all the changes last week to integrate the Global Assembly Cache work that Jackson, Sebastien, Todd and all the volunteers helped us deploy.</p>

			<a name="Apr22nd,2004:XSP0.12released.">
			<h2>Apr 22nd, 2004: XSP 0.12 released.</h2>
			<p>A new release of XSP is available. It fixes a bug that made Web Services unusable from client proxies. You can download it from <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/xsp-0.12.tar.gz">here</a>.</p>

			<a name="Apr21st,2004:XSP0.11andmod_mono0.8released.">
			<h2>Apr 21st, 2004: XSP 0.11 and mod_mono 0.8 released.</h2>
			<p>Gonzalo has made new releases of XSP and mod_mono (The ASP.NET hosting service for Mono).</p>
			<p>Check the XSP/mod_mono <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/xsp-0.10.html">Release Notes</a> to see what is new and to obtain the source packages.</p>

			<a name="Apr20,2004:S390port;InterpretedUpdated;Identityclasses;System.Drawing;MonoDebugger.">
			<h2>Apr 20, 2004: S390 port; Interpreted Updated;  Identity classes;  System.Drawing; Mono Debugger.</h2>
			<p>Neale who originally wrote the S390 interpreter support for Mono has checked into CVS his port of the S390 JIT engine. Now, if we could only have one of those in our living room.</p>
			<p>Bernie has checked into CVS a new interpreter for the Mono runtime.  This new interpreter translates the CIL opcodes into a new intermediate representation.  The new IL representation avoids doing costly lookups during interpretation which means that the interpreter is a lot faster now.</p>
			<p>Performance wise, the new interpreter is three times faster than the old one when doing a compiler bootstrap.</p>

			<p>Sebastien has recently completed the identity classes in the Mono Runtime, you can see more details on his <a href="http://pages.infinit.net/ctech/poupou.html">blog</a></p>
			<p>New progress on the GDI+ front: Jordi has completed the region code; Ravindra the various brushes that we must support; Sanjay the Icon and BMP loaders (with Mark) and Vladimir has contributed various codecs and a new fresh implementation of Image.LockBits.</p>
			<p>Lluis and Atsushi in the meantime has been in charge of completing various pending items from our class libraries: basically an API audit of the things missing for the Mono 1.0 release, small but important things.</p>
			<p>Martin has replaced the old command-line language in the debugger with our home-grown "Command Line" language, a TCL-like command line language that we built for it (its a tiny .NETized Tcl-like language).  The interaction process is a lot smoother than it used to be and we are focusing on the usability of the command line language to improve the debugging experience.</p>

			<a name="Apr02,2004:MonoC#CompilergetsCLSsupport;BasicRuntimeContributionfromMainsoft.">
			<h2>Apr 02, 2004: Mono C# Compiler gets CLS support;   Basic Runtime Contribution from Mainsoft.</h2>

			<p>Marek Safar has been working for a few months on adding support to the C# compiler to support the various checks required by the Common Language Specification (CLS).</p>
			<p>In the past the C# compiler was unable to flag any problems related to the creation of cross-language libraries.  Today with this patch the compiler will properly flag errors in CLS compliance.  Tests for all of the errors have also been included on CVS.</p>
			<p><a href="http://www.mainsoft.com">Mainsoft</a> has contributed an implementation of their Basic runtime to the project.  The runtime they wrote is written in Java and we are translating this into C# code.  The code will reach CVS within the next few weeks.</p>
			<p>Mainsoft also contributed an extensive regression test suite for the Basic runtime, a port of the NIST XML tests and their own in-house developed XML tests.</p>

			<a name="Mar15th,2004:AsyncIOlandsonMono.">
			<h2>Mar 15th, 2004: Async IO lands on Mono.</h2>
			<p>Gonzalo has completed the implementation of Async I/O for Mono using the kernel aio_* interfaces.  If your operating system supports the aio_ POSIX interface, the FileStream methods that expose asynchronous methods will use this facility instead of emulating it with threads as we have done in the past.</p>
			<p>We had this request come to us from various people in the past, and we are now looking for your help to test and debug this.</p>
