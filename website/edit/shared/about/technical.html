	<h2>Mono Platforms </h2>
	<p><b>Question:</b> What operating systems does Mono run on?</p>
	<p>Mono is known to run on Linux, UNIX and Windows systems.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> Can I run Mono applications without using 'mono program.exe'?</p>
	<p>Yes, this is possible on Linux systems, to do this, use something like:</p>
<pre>
if [ ! -e /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register ]; then
	/sbin/modprobe binfmt_misc
	mount -t binfmt_misc none /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc
fi

if [ -e /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register ]; then
	echo ':CLR:M::MZ::/usr/bin/mono:' > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register
else
	echo "No binfmt_misc support"
	exit 1
fi
</pre>

	<p><b>Question:</b> What architectures does Mono support?</p>

	<p>Mono today ships with a Just-in-Time compiler for x86,
	PowerPC, S390 and SPARC-based systems.  It is tested regularly
	on Linux, FreeBSD and Windows (with the XP/NT core).</p>
	<p>There is also an interpreter, which is slower that runs on
	the x86, s390, SPARC, HPPA, StrongARM and PowerPC
	architectures.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> Can Mono run on Windows 9x, or ME
	editions?</p>

	<p>Mono requires Unicode versions of Win32 APIs to run, and
	only a handful of *W functions is supported under Win9x.</p>
	<p>There is Microsoft Layer for Unicode that provides
	implementation of these APIs on 9x systems.</p>

	<p>Unfortunately it uses linker trick for delayed load that is
	not supported by ld, so some sort of adapter is necessary. You
	will need MSLU and one of the following libs to link Mono to
	unicows.dll <a
	href="javascript:openExternal('http://mono.eurosoft.od.ua/files/unimono.zip');">http://mono.eurosoft.od.ua/files/unimono.zip</a>
	or alternatively search the net for "libunicows".</p>

	<p>No changes to Mono source code required, the only thing is
	to make sure that linker will resolve imports to adapter
	library instead of Win32 libs. This is achieved by inserting
	-lunimono before -lkerner32/user32 in the linker's specs
	file.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> Why support Windows, when you can run the
	real thing?</p>
	<p>There are various reasons:</p>

	<ul>
		<li> About half the contributors to Mono are Windows developers. They have many different reasons for contributing to the effort, and we find it very important to let those developers run the runtime on Windows without forcing them to use a new operating system.</li>
		<li> Supporting Windows helps us identify the portable portions of Mono from the non-portable versions of it, helping Mono become more portable in the future.</li>
		<li> Mono does not heavily modify the windows registry, update system DLLs, install DLLs to the Windows/System32 path.  Another words, I knew Mono would not cause any legacy enterprise applications to stop working - and it hasn't.  However, our CIO er is againt it because of the changes that would be made to Windows 2000, such as, affecting security.</li>
	</ul>

	<a name="compatibility"></a>
	<h2>Compatibility</h2>
	<p><b>Question:</b> Can Mono run applications developed with
	the Microsoft.NET framework?</p>
	<p>Yes, Mono can run applications developed with the Microsoft
	.NET Framework on UNIX.  There are a few caveats to keep in
	mind: Mono has not been completed yet, so a few API calls
	might be missing; And in some cases the Mono behavior *might*
	be incorrect.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> Will missing API entry points be
	implemented?</p>

	<p>Yes, the goal of Mono is to implement precisely the .NET
	Framework API (as well as compile-time selectable subsets, for
	those interested in a lighter version of Mono).</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> If the behavior of an API call is
	different, will you fix it?</p>
	<p>Yes, we will.  But we will need your assistance for this.
	If you find a bug in the Mono implementation, please fill a
	bug report in <a
	href="javascript:openExternal('http://bugzilla.ximian.com');">http://bugzilla.ximian.com</a>. Do
	not assume we know about the problem, we might not, and using
	the bug tracking system helps us organize the development
	process.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> Can I develop my applications on Windows,
	and deploy on a supported Mono platform (like Linux)?</p>

	<p>Yes, you can.</p>
	<p>As of today, Mono is not 100% finished, so it is sometimes
	useful to compile the code with Mono, to find out if your
	application depends on unimplemented functionality.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> Will applications run out the box with
	Mono?</p>
	<p>Sometimes they will.  But sometimes a .NET application
	might invoke Win32 API calls, or assume certain patterns that
	are not correct for cross-platform applications.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> What is a 100% .NET application?</p>

	<p>A '100% .NET application' is one that only uses the APIs
	defined under the System namespace and does not use P/Invoke.
	These applications would in theory run unmodified on Windows,
	Linux, HP-UX, Solaris, MacOS X and others.</p>
	<p>Note that this requirement also holds for all assemblies
	used by the application.  If one of them is Windows-specific,
	then the entire program is not a 100% .NET application.</p>
	<p>Furthermore, a 100% .NET application must not contain
	non-standard data streams in the assembly.  For example,
	Visual Studio .NET will insert a <tt>#-</tt> stream into
	assemblies built under the "Debug" target. This stream
	contains debugging information for use by Visual Studio .NET;
	however, this stream can not be interpreted by Mono (unless
	you're willing to donate support).</p>
	<p>Thus, it is recommended that all Visual Studio
	.NET-compiled code be compiled under the Release target before
	it is executed under Mono.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> Can I execute my Visual Studio .NET
	program (Visual Basic .NET, Visual C#, Managed Extensions for
	C++, etc.) under Mono?</p>

	<p>Yes, with some reservations.</p>
	<p>The .NET program must either be a 100% .NET application, or
	(somehow) have all dependent assemblies available on all
	desired platforms.  (How to do so is outside the bounds of
	this FAQ.)</p>
	<p>Mono must also have an implementation for the .NET
	assemblies used.  For example the System.EnterpriseServices
	namespace is part of .NET, but it has not been implemented in
	Mono.  Thus, any applications using this namespace will not
	run under Mono.</p>
	<p>With regards to languages, C# applications tend to be most
	portable.</p>
	<p>Visual Basic .NET applications are portable, but Mono's
	Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll implementation is incomplete.  It is
	recommended to either avoid using this assembly in your own
	code, only use the portions that Mono has implemented, or to
	help implement the missing features.  Additionally, you can
	set 'Option Strict On', which eliminates the implicit calls to
	the unimplemented
	Microsoft.VisualBasic.CompilerServices.ObjectType
	class. (Thanks to Jörg Rosenkranz.)</p>
	<p>Managed Extensions for C++ is least likely to operate under
	Mono.  Mono does not support mixed mode assemblies (that is,
	assemblies containing both managed and unmanaged code, which
	Managed C++ can produce).  You need a fully-managed assembly
	to run under Mono, and getting the Visual C++ .NET compiler to
	generate such an executable can be difficult.  You need to use
	only the .NET-framework assemblies, not the C libraries (you
	can't use
	<b>printf</b>(3) for example.), and you need
	to use the linker options <tt>/nodefaultlib
	/entry:main mscoree.lib</tt> in addition to
	the <tt>/clr</tt> compiler flag.  You can
	still use certain compiler intrinsic functions
	(such as <b>memcpy</b>(3)) and the STL. You
	should also see <a
	href="javascript:openExternal('http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/vcmex/html/vcgrfconvertingmanagedextensionsforcprojectsfrommixed-modetopureil.asp');">Converting
	Managed Extensions for C++ Projects from Mixed
	Mode to Pure Intermediate Language</a> at
	MSDN. Finally, you can use PEVERIFY.EXE from
	the .NET SDK to determine if the assembly is
	fully managed.</p>

	<p>Thanks to Serge Chaban for the linker flags to use.</p>

	<h2>Mono and Portable.NET</h2>
	<p><b>Question:</b> What are the differences between Mono and
	Portable.NET?</p>
	<p>Most of Mono is being written using C#, with only a few
	parts written in C (The JIT engine, the runtime, the
	interfaces to the garbage collection system).</p>

	<p>It is easier to describe what is unique about Mono:</p>
	<ul>

		<li>An advanced native-code compilation engine: Both
		just-in-time compilation (JIT) and pre-compilation of
		CIL bytecodes into native code are supported.</li>
	
		<li>A foundation for code optimization: The new code
		generator in Mono builds on the experience of our
		first JIT engine, and enables us to implement various
		advanced compiler optimization tricks.  With an
		SSA-framework, plenty of new optimizations are
		possible.<br />The current list of optimizations are:
		Peephole postpass, Branch optimizations, Inline method
		calls, Constant folding, Constant propagation, Copy
		propagation, Dead code elimination, Linear scan global
		reg allocation, Conditional moves, Emit per-domain
		code, Instruction scheduling, Intrinsic method
		implementations, Tail recursion and tail calls, Loop
		related optimizations, Fast x86 FP compares, Leaf
		procedures optimizations</li>
		
		<li>A self-hosting C# compiler written in C#, which is
		clean, easy to maintain.</li>

		<li>A multi-platform runtime engine: both a JIT engine
		and an interpreter exist.  The JIT engine runs
		currently on x86, PowerPC, S390 and Sparc systems,
		while the interpreter works on x86, SPARC, StrongARM,
		s390 and PowerPC systems.<br />The JIT engine is being
		ported to amd64 systems at this time.</li>

		<li> The JIT engine is written using a portable
		instruction selector which not only generates good
		code but is also the foundation to re-target the JIT
		engine to other systems.</li>
		
		<li>Full support for remoting in the runtime.</li>
		
		<li>The C# compiler, the JIT engine and the class
		libraries are mature enough that the whole system has
		been self-hosting since April 2002.  This means that
		we develop Mono completely with itself at this
		point.<br />By forcing ourselves to use our own code
		to develop our tools, we bug fix problems rapidly, and
		the system is overall more robust and tested than if
		we did not.</li>
		

		<li> Our class libraries are licensed under the terms
		of the MIT X11 license which is a very liberal license
		as opposed to the GNU GPL with exceptions, this means
		that Mono can be used in places where the GPL with
		exceptions is not permissible.</li>
		
		<li> Mono has a complete Web Services stack: we
		implement ASP.NET web servers and web clients as well
		as implementing the Remoting-based SOAP
		infrastructure.</li>
		
		<li> Remoting implementation: Mono has a complete
		remoting infrastructure that is used in our own
		codebase to provide added functionality and
		performance to our ASP.NET engine and more.</li>
		
		<li> Mono has a complete <a href="/using/mcs.html">C#
		1.0</a> implementation and has been stress tested a
		lot more than Portable.NET's compiler.</li>

		<li>Mono's C# compiler flags more errors and warnings
		on invalid C# code.

		<li>Mono's C# compiler is a CLS consumer and producer,
		which means that it will enforce during development
		the CLS rules.

		<li>Mono's C# compiler has strong error handling and
		has closer adherence to the specification with support
		for definite assignment (required to generate
		verifiable IL code).</li>
		
		<li> Mono's C# compiler is written in C# which is
		easier for new developers to come in and improve, fix
		and tune.  The Mono C# compiler in C# is faster than
		their C-based compiler.</li>
		
		<li> Preview of C# 2.0: a work in progress for a 2.0
		implementation of our compiler is available
		(iterators, generics and anonymous methods are
		available in our "preview" compiler).</li>
		
		<li>Mono has a complete Reflection and
		Reflection.Emit: these are important for advanced
		applications, compilers and dynamic code generation
		(Applications like IKVM and IronPython depend on this
		feature for example).</li>
		
		<li> Mono has a <a
		href="/contributing/xml-classes.html">complete managed
		XML stack</a>: XML, XPath, XML Serializer, XML Schema
		handling are fully functional, feature complete and
		tuned for performance.  In addition to the Microsoft
		API, mono ships with the Mono.Xml.Ext library that
		contains an XQuery/XPath2 implementations.</li>
		

		<li> Mono has a <a
		href="/contributing/crypto.html">complete cryptography
		stack</a>: we implement the 1.0 and 1.1 APIs as well
		as using our fully managed stack to implement the
		SSL/TLS transports.</li>
		
		<li> <a href="/contributing/ado-net.html">Extensive
		database support</a>: Mono ships with database
		provides for <a
		href="/contributing/firebird.html">Firebird</a>, <a
		href="/contributing/ibmdb2.html">IBM DB2</a>, <a
		href="/contributing/oracle.html">Oracle</a>, <a

		href="/contributing/postgresql.html">PostgresSQL</A>,
		<a href="/contributing/oledb.html">Ole DB</a> and <a
		href="/contributing/odbc.html">ODBC</a>.</li>
		

		<li> Mono includes LDAP support.</li>

		<li> Mono has a larger community of
		active developers.  Full time
		developer from companies (Novell and
		Mainsoft) as well as volunteers from
		the community.

	</ul>
	
	<p>In general, Mono is more mature and complete since it has
	been used to develop itself, which is a big motivator for
	stability and correctness, while Portable.NET remains pretty
	much an untested platform.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> I hear Mono keeps changing the P/Invoke
	API, why?</p>

	<p>We are just fixing our implementation to be compatible with
	the Microsoft implementation.  In other words, the Mono
	P/Invoke API is more complete when compared to the
	Portable.NET version, hence various pieces of software that
	depend on this extended functionality fail to work properly
	with Portable.NET.</p>

	<a name="webservices"></a>
	<h2>Web Services</h2>
	<p><b>Question:</b> How is Mono related to Web Services?</p>
	<p>Mono is only related to Web Services in that it will
	implement the same set of classes that have been authored in
	the .NET Framework to simplify and streamline the process of
	building Web Services.</p>

	<p>But most importantly, Mono is an Open Source implementation
	of the .NET Framework.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> Can I author Web Services with Mono?</p>
	<p>You will be able to write Web Services on .NET that run on
	Mono and vice-versa.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> If Mono implements the SDK classes, will I
	be able to write and execute .NET Web Services with it?</p>

	<p>Yes.  When the project is finished, you will be able to use
	the same technologies that are available through the .NET
	Framework SDK on Windows to write Web Services.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> What about Soup?  Can I use Soup without
	Mono?</p>
	<p>Soup is a library for GNOME applications to create SOAP
	servers and SOAP clients, and can be used without Mono.  You
	can browse the source code for soup using <a
	href="javascript:openExternal('http://cvs.gnome.org/bonsai/');">GNOME's
	Bonsai</a>.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> Can I use CORBA?</p>

	<p>Yes. The CLI contains enough information about a class that
	exposing it to other RPC systems (like CORBA) is really
	simple, and does not even require support from an object.</p>
	<p><a
	href="javascript:openExternal('http://remoting-corba.sourceforge.net/');">Remoting.CORBA</a>
	is a CORBA implementation that is gaining momentum.</p>
	<p>Building an implementation of the Bonobo interfaces once
	this is ready should be relatively simple.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> Can I serialize my objects to other things
	other than XML?</p>

	<p>Yes, although the serializing tools have not yet been
	planned, and you would probably have to implement them
	yourself.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> Will Mono use ORBit?</p>
	<p>There are a few advantages in using ORBit, like reusing
	existing code and leveraging all the work done on it.  Michael
	Meeks has posted a few <a
	href="javascript:openExternal('http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2002-September/008592.html');">reasons</a>,
	as well as some <a
	href="javascript:openExternal('http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2002-September/008657.html');">ideas</a>
	that could be used to reuse ORBit.</p>

	<p>Most users are likely to choose a native .NET solution,
	like <a
	href="javascript:openExternal('http://cvs.gnome.org/bonsai');">Remoting.CORBA</a></p>

	<a name="monodoc"></a>
	<h2>MonoDoc</h2>
	<p><b>Question:</b> What is MonoDoc?</p>
	<p>MonoDoc is a graphical documentation browser for the Mono
	class libraries. Currently, monodoc consists of a Gtk#
	application and is in heavy development.</p>

	<a name="devel"></a>
	<h2>Development Tools and Issues</h2>
	<p>
	<p><b>Question:</b> I am having trouble compiling a new
	version of Mono from SVN, it complains about my runtime being
	out of sync.</p>
	<p>To upgrade your class libraries and compiler, see the
	INSTALL.txt in the MCS directory.</p>
	<p>The single biggest source of confusion seems to be the
	"Your runtime is out of sync" messages.  Realize that this is
	*normal* while BUILDING.  Think about it: you're building a
	new class library with the old runtime.  If the new class
	library references a function that the old runtime knows
	nothing about, the runtime system issues this warning.</p>

	<p>Basically what needs to happen is for a new mono runtime to
	be compiled, then the corlib class library be compiled, and
	once this is done, install the new runtime, followed by
	corlib.</p>
	<p>Once this is done, you can continue building your entire
	environment.</p>
	<p>For instance you just need to: 1.- Upgrade your Mono
	runtime (you might better do it with the mono-build.sh script
	available <a href="/contributing/mono-build.sh">here</a>). 2.-
	Get the latest mono-lite tarball from the daily snapshots <a
	href="javascript:openExternal('http://www.go-mono.com/daily/');">page</a>,
	unzip and untar and copy all the dll files to your install
	path lib directory (typically pointed by the $MONO_PATH
	variable). Copy all the exe files to the install path bin
	directory. 3.- Then checkout or update your mcs SVN copy. Then
	follow the steps described in mcs/INSTALL.txt.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> Will it be possible to use the CLI
	features without using byte codes or the JIT?</p>

	<p>Yes. The CLI engine will be made available as a shared
	library. The garbage collection engine, the threading
	abstraction, the object system, the dynamic type code system
	and the JIT are available for C developers to integrate with
	their applications if they wish to do so.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> Will you have new development tools?</p>
	<p>With any luck, Free Software enthusiasts will contribute
	tools to improve the developer environment.  These tools could
	be developed initially using the Microsoft implementation of
	the CLI and then executed later with Mono.</p>
	<p>We are recommending people to use and contribute to
	existing projects like SharpDevelop, Anjuta and Eclipse.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> What kind of rules make the Common
	Intermediate Language useful for JITers?</p>

	<p>The main rule is that the stack in the CLI is not a general
	purpose stack.  You are not allowed to use it for other
	purposes than computing values and passing arguments to
	functions or return values.</p>
	<p>At any given call or return instruction, the types on the
	stack have to be the same independently of the flow of
	execution of your code.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> Is it true that the CIL is ideal for
	JITing and not efficient for interpreters?</p>
	<p>The CIL is better suited to be JITed than JVM byte codes,
	but you can interpret them as trivially as you can interpret
	JVM byte codes.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> Isn't it a little bit confusing to have
	the name of "XSP" (the same as in the Apache Project) for the
	ASP.NET support in Mono?.
	<p>In Mono, xsp is just the name of the C# code generator for
	ASP.NET pages. In the Apache Project, it is a term for the
	"eXtensible Server Pages" technology so as they are very
	different things, they don't conflict.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> Are there any plan to develop an aspx
	server for Mono?.</p>
	<p>The XSP reference server is available and you can also use
	mod_mono with Apache.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> Is there any way I can develop the class
	libraries using Linux yet?</p>
	<p>Yes.  Mono has been self hosting since May 2002.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> Is there any way I can install a known
	working copy of mono in /usr, and an experimental copy
	somewhere else, and have both copies use their own libraries?
	(I'm still not very good at library paths in Linux)</p>
	<p>Yes. Just use two installation prefixes.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> How should I write tests or a tests
	suite?</p>
	<p>If you do a test suite for C#, you might want to keep it
	independent of the Mono C# compiler, so that other compiler
	implementations can later use it.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> Would it be too terrible to have another
	corlib signed as mscorlib?</p>
	<p>We rename corlib to mscorlib also when saving the PE files,
	in fact, the runtime can execute program created by mono just
	fine.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> Is it possible to build a C# file to some
	sort of intermediate format which can linked into a final
	module, like the traditional .c -> .o -> .so path?</p>
	<p>You can use:</p>

	<p>mcs /target:library file1.cs, mcs /target:library
	file2.cs,<br />mcs /target:exe file1.dll file2.dll
	/out:mybin.exe</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> Is there any plans for implementing
	remoting in the near future?</p>
	<p>The remoting infrastructure is in place.  We have
	implementations of the TcpChannel, HttpChannel and the Soap
	and Binary Formatters. They are compatible with .NET.</p>
	<p>However, some classes from the library may have a different
	binary representation, because they may have a different
	internal data structure, so for example you won't be able to
	exchange a Hastable object between Mono and MS.NET. It should
	not be a problem if you are using primitive types, arrays or
	your own classes. In any case, could you post a test case?</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> My C code uses the __stdcall which is not
	availble on Linux, how can I make the code portable
	Windows/UNIX across platforms?</p>
	<p>Replace the __stdcall attribute with the STDCALL macro, and
	include this in your C code for newer gcc versions: <pre>
	#ifndef STDCALL #define STDCALL __attribute__((stdcall))
	#endif </pre>

	<p><b>Question:</b> I want to be able to execute Mono
	binaries, without having to use the "mono" command.  How can I
	do this?</p>

	<p>From Carlos Perelló:<br/><br/>
	<i>I think that the best solution is the binfmt feature with the wrapper that exists with Debian packages at:<br/>
	<a href="javascript:openExternal('http://www.debianplanet.org/mono/dists/unstable/main/source/admin/');">http://www.debianplanet.org/mono/dists/unstable/main/source/admin/</a><br/><br/>
	If you want use it with Big endian machines, you should apply a patch (<a href="javascript:openExternal('http://carlos.pemas.net/debian/mono/binfmt-detector-cli.c.diff');">http://carlos.pemas.net/debian/mono/binfmt-detector-cli.c.diff</a>)<br/><br/>
	It works really good and lets you use wine also, it reads the .exe file headers and check if it's a .net executable.<br/><br/>
	This way you just execute: ./my-cool-mono-application.exe and it works without the need of any wrapper.</i></p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> I see funny characters when I run
	programs, what is the problem?</p>
	<p>(From Peter Williams and Gonzalo Paniagua):</p>
	
	<p>This is Red Hat 9 (probably) using UTF8 on its console; the
	bytes are the UTF8 endianness markers.  You can do:</p> <pre>
	LC_ALL=C mono myexe.exe </pre>
	<p>And they wont show up.</p>

	<p>Alternatively, you can do:</p> <pre> $ echo -e "\033%G"
	</pre>
	<p>to enable UTF-8 on the console.</p>

	<h2>Mono and ASP.NET</h2>
	<p><b>Question:</b> Does Mono support ASP.NET?</p>

	<p>Yes.</p>
	<p>Mono supports ASP.NET, we have shown an unmodified IBuySpy
	installation running on Mono as well as various other
	programs.  You can try it yourself downloading the XSP
	server.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> Do I need install cygwin to work on
	ASP.NET in mono or Linux is enough since it is self host right
	now?</p>
	<p>Linux is enough.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> How can I run ASP.NET-based applications
	with Mono?</p>

	<p>You need the Mono runtime and a hosting web server.
	Currently we distribute a small web server called 'xsp' which
	is used to debug applications, or you can choose to use
	Daniel's Apache 2 module.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> Any plan to make ASP.NET in mono works
	with Apache in Linux?.
	<p>Daniel has authored an Apache2 Module for Mono that hosts
	the ASP.NET runtime and is available here: <a
	href="javascript:openExternal('http://apacheworld.org/modmono/');">http://apacheworld.org/modmono/</a></p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> Will you support Apache 1?</p>

	<p>Modules developed for Apache 2 are not compatible with
	Apache 1.3 Daniel plans to support Apache 1.3 in the future
	but the current focus is on Apache 2, because of the better
	support for threading and Windows.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> Can I run Apache 1 and Apache 2 on the
	same machine?</p>
	<p>You can always keep a copy of Apache 2 running in parallel
	with your Apache 1.3 (either different port or using a reverse
	proxy).</p>
	<p>You can also bind the two servers to different IP addresses
	on the same physical machine.</p>

	<a name="ado"></a>
	<h2>Mono and ADO.NET</h2>

	<p><b>Question:</b> What is the status of ADO.NET
	support?. Could I start migrating applications from MS.NET to
	Mono?</p>
	<p>You could start right now using the ADO.NET support in
	mono, of course, if you want to help filling the missing gaps
	while you develop your app :-) Well, what I mean is that we're
	not that far to having full ADO.NET support in Mono, and we've
	got a lot of working things, so if we could get more help,
	we'd finish it really soon :-)</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> In developing the data architecture for
	the application are there and objects I should stay away from
	in order to insure the smoothest possible transition (minimum
	code rewrite) to Mono's ADO.NET implementation?  (For example,
	strongly typed datasets versus untyped datasets, etc...)</p>
	<p>We are implementing all the classes in Microsoft .NET's
	System.Data, so you can be sure that things will work the same
	in Mono as with the Microsoft implementation.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> Does Mono can to connect to Sybase by
	using Mono.Data.*?</p>
	<p>Yes. use Mono.Data.SybaseClient. First of all you have to
	create a SybaseConnection, and then, from it, use it as any
	other IDbConnection-based class.</p>

	<a name="java"></a>
	<h2>Mono and Java</h2>
	<p><b>Question:</b> Why don't you use Java?  After all, there
	are many languages that target the Java VM.</p>
	<p>You can get very good tools for doing Java development on
	free systems right now.  <a
	href="javascript:openExternal('http://www.redhat.com');">Red
	Hat</a> has contributed a <a
	href="javascript:openExternal('http://gcc.gnu.org');">GCC</a>
	<a
	href="javascript:openExternal('http://gcc.gnu.org/java/');">front-end
	for Java</a> that can take Java sources or Java byte codes and
	generate native executables; <a
	href="javascript:openExternal('http://www.google.com/search?q=transvirtual');">Transvirtual</a>
	implemented <a
	href="javascript:openExternal('http://www.kaffe.org');">Kaffe</a>
	a JIT engine for Java; Intel also has a Java VM called <a
	href="javascript:openExternal('http://www.intel.com/research/mrl/orp/');">ORP</a>.</p>

	<p>The JVM is not designed to be a general purpose virtual
	machine. The Common Intermediate Language (CIL), on the other
	hand, is designed to be a target for a wide variety of
	programming languages, and has a set of rules designed to be
	optimal for JITers.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> Could Java target the CLI?</p>
	<p>Yes, Java could target the CLI, Microsoft's J# compiler
	does that.</p>
	<p>The <a
	href="javascript:openExternal('http://www.ikvm.net/');">IKVM</a>
	project builds a Java runtime that works on top of .NET and on
	top of Mono.  IKVM is essentially a JIT compiler that
	translates from JVM bytecodes into CIL instructions, and then
	lets the native JIT engine take over.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> Is it possible to write a JVM byte code to
	CIL converter?</p>
	<p>Yes, this is what <a
	href="javascript:openExternal('http://www.ikvm.net/');">IKVM</a>
	does.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> Could mono become a hybrid CIL/java
	platform?</p>

	<p>This can be obtained easily with IKVM.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> Do you plan to implement a Javascript
	compiler?</p>
	<p>Yes.  The beginnings of the JScript compiler can be found
	on SVN. Cesar coordinates this effort.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> Can Mono or .NET share system classes
	(loaded from mscore.dll and other libs) or will it behave like
	Sun's Java VM?</p>

	<p>What you can do with mono is to load different applications
	in their own application domain: this is a feature of the CLR
	that allows sandboxing applications inside a single process
	space. This is usualy exploited to compartmentalize different
	parts of the same app, but it can also be effectively used to
	reduce the startup and memory overhead. Using different
	appdomains the runtime representation of types and methods is
	shared across applications.</p>

	<a name="extending"></a>
	<h2>Extending Mono</h2>
	<p><b>Question:</b> Would you allow other classes other than
	those in the specification?</p>
	<p>Yes.  The Microsoft class collection is very big, but it is
	by no means complete.  It would be nice to have a port of
	'Camel' (the Mail API used by Evolution inspired by Java Mail)
	for Mono applications.</p>

	<p>You might also want to look into implementing CORBA for
	Mono.  Not only because it would be useful, but because it
	sounds like a fun thing to do, given the fact that the CLI is
	such a type rich system.</p>
	<p>For more information on extending Mono, see our <a
	href="ideas.html">ideas</a> page.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> Do you plan to Embrace and Extend
	.NET?</p>
	<p>Embracing a good technology is good.  Extending
	technologies in incompatible ways is bad for the users, so we
	do not plan on making incompatible changes to the
	technologies.</p>

	<p>If you have innovative ideas, and want to create new
	classes, we encourage you to make those classes operate
	correctly well in both Mono and .NET.</p>
	<p>Today Mono ships with a number of extra libraries that were
	developed either by members of the Mono community, or other
	groups.</p>
	<p>In some cases, we have found the bits from Microsoft to be
	incomplete, but we avoid breaking the API, instead we expose
	the missing functionality in new assemblies (See Mono.Security
	and System.Security).</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> Is there any way I can develop the class
	libraries using Linux yet?</p>
	<p>Yes.  Mono has been selfhosting since March 2002.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> Is there any way I can install a known
	working copy of mono in /usr, and an experimental copy
	somewhere else, and have both copies use their own libraries?
	(I'm still not very good at library paths in Linux)</p>
	<p>Yes. Just use two installation prefixes.</p>

	<a name="portability"></a>
	<h2>Portability</h2>
	<p><b>Question:</b> Will Mono only work on Linux?</p>

	<p>Currently, we are doing our work on Linux-based systems and
	Windows.  We do not expect many Linux-isms in the code, so it
	should be easy to port Mono to other UNIX variants.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> What about Mono on non Linux-based
	systems?</p>
	<p>Our main intention at Novell is to be able to develop GNOME
	applications with Mono, but if you are interested in providing
	a port of the Winforms classes to other platforms (frame
	buffer or MacOS X for example), we would gladly integrate
	them, as long they are under an open source license.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> What operating systems/CPUs do you
	support</p>

	<p>Mono currently runs on Linux, Windows, Solaris, FreeBSD,
	HP-UX and MacOS X.</p>
	<p>The Just-In-Time engine (JIT) is available on x86 and
	PowerPC, Sparc and S390 processors and can generate code and
	optimizations tailored for a particular CPU.</p>
	<p>Interpreters exist for the Itanium, HP-PA, StrongARM
	CPUs.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> Does Mono run on Windows?</p>
	<p>Yes.  You can get pre-compiled binaries from <a
	href="/downloads/index.html">http://www.mono-project.com/downloads/index.html</a></p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> Does Mono run on Linux?</p>
	<p>Yes.  You can get pre-compiled binaries from <a
	href="/downloads/index.html">http://www.mono-project.com/downloads/index.html</a></p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> Will I require Cygwin to run mono?</p>
	<p>No.  Cygwin is only required to build Mono.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> Will Mono depend on GNOME?</p>
	<p>It will depend only if you are using a particular assembly
	(for example, for doing GUI applications).  If you are just
	interested in Mono for implementing a 'Hello World Enterprise
	P2P Web Service', you will not need any GNOME components.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> Do you plan to port Rhino to C#?.</p>
	<p>Eto Demerzal has started a Rhino port to C#.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> Has anyone succeeded in building a Mac
	version of the C# environment. If so can you explain how?</p>
	<p>Yes, Mono works on Linux/PPC and MacOS X (10.2 and
	10.3)</p>

	<a name="reuse"></a>
	<h2>Reusing Existing Code</h2>
	<p><b>Question:</b> What projects will you reuse or build
	upon?</p>

	<p>We want to get Mono in the hands of programmers soon.  We
	are interested in reusing existing open source software.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> Will I be able to use Microsoft SQL Server
	2000 or will I need to switch to a specific Open Source
	Database. Will I need to recode?</p>
	<p>There is no need to rewrite your code as long as you keep
	using Microsoft SQL Server.  If you want to use an open source
	database, you might need to make changes to your code.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> What do I need to watch out for when
	programming in VB.NET so that I'm sure to be able to run those
	apps on Linux?</p>

	<p>Not making any P/Invoke or DLL calls should and not using
	anything in the Microsoft.* namespaces should suffice. Also do
	not use any Methods/Classes marked as "This type/method
	supports the .NET Framework infrastructure and is not intended
	to be used directly from your code." even if you know what
	these classes/methods do.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> Will built-in reporting be supported for
	crystal reports? This is a heavily used part of our
	system.</p>
	<p>Crystal Reports are propriety. Someone may try to emulate
	the behavior, but no-one has yet volunteered.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> Who about writing to the registry? As I
	understand it, Linux does not have a counterpart to the
	registry. Should I avoid relying on that feature?</p>

	<p>Try to avoid it. Although there would be a emulation for
	registry in Mono too. GNOME does have a registry like
	mechanism for configuration. But Even if gnome has a
	configuration system similar to the registry, the keys will
	not be equal, so you will probably end up having to do some
	runtime detection, and depending on this load an assembly that
	has your platform-specific hacks.</p>

	<p><b>Question:</b> System.Data.SqlClient with FreeTDS, will
	you port parts of these to C# and use them?</p>
	<p>This has been done.</p>

	<a name="gcc"></a>
	<h2>Mono and GCC</h2>

	<p><b>Question:</b> Are you working on a GCC front-end to
	C#?</p>
	<p>We are not working on a GCC front-end for C#</p>



	<p><b>Question:</b> What about making a front-end to GCC that
	takes CIL images and generates native code?</p>

	<p>There is no active work on this area, but Mono already
	provides pre-compilation services (Ahead-of-Time
	compilation).</p>

	<p><a name="q123b"></a><b>Question:</b> Will you support C/C++
	on the Mono VM?</p>

	<p>There are no current plans to do this, but a few research
	efforts in this direction.

	<p><b>Question:</b> I have a C++ library that I would like to
	call from Mono, what can I do?

	<p>There are a few possible approaches:

	<ul>
	
		<li>Use a code generator such as SWIG that parses the
		C++ code and generates C wrapper functions and C# code which
		DllImports the C wrappers.

		<p>Pro: This permits use of C++ code from C#
		
		<p>Con: Not terribly elegant; Extra layer of C code may impact performance.

		<li>There was work on a WHIRL-to-IL compiler, which would compile C
		(and probably C++) into CIL which Mono could execute.

		<li>Modify GCC's to produce CIL.
		
	</ul>
	

	<p><a name="q123b"></a><b>Question:</b>What is the WHIRL-to-IL
	tion for using C++ with Mono?</p>

	<p>WHIRL is the name for the intermediate reprsentation
	produced by SGI's Open64 compiler.
	
	<p>The Open64 compiler is a modified version of GCC that
	generates a new intermediate language instead of RTL.  This
	could be the foundation to generate CIL code, and to implement
	the upcoming Managed extensions to C++ from ECMA.</p>
	
	<p>Open64 (and other derivative forks of GCC) split the gcc
	front-ends from the backends by using the WHIRL intermediate
	representation. Kris has begun the implementation of a
	translator from WHIRL to CIL. So it will be possible to use
	the GCC compilers to target the CIL.</p>
	
	<p><b>Question 126bis:</b>What about Managed C++?</p>

	<p>Once a full translator for WHIRL exists, we are interested
	in looking at expanding the GCC frontends to include
	extensions for Managed C++.</p>

	<a name="performance"></a>
	<h2>Performance</h2>

	<p><b>Question:</b> How fast will Mono be?</p>
	<p>We can not predict the future, but a conservative estimate
	is that it would be at least 'as fast as other JIT
	engines'.</p>
	<p>Mono's JIT engine has been recently re-architected, and it
	provides many new features, and layers suitable for
	optimization.  It is relatively easy to add new optimizations
	to Mono.</p>
	<p>The CIL has some advantages over the Java byte code: The
	existance of structs in addition to classes helps a lot the
	performance and minimizes the memory footprint of
	applications.</p>
	<p>Generics in the CLI world are first-class citizens, they
	are not just a strong-typing addition to the language.  The
	generic specifications are embedded into the instruction
	stream, the JIT uses this information to JIT a unique
	instances of a method that is optimized for the type
	arguments.</p>

	<p>The CIL is really an intermediate representation and there
	are a number of restrictions on how you can emit CIL code that
	simplify creating better JIT engines.</p>
	<p>For example, on the CIL, the stack is not really an
	abstraction available for the code generator to use at will.
	Rather, it is a way of creating a postfix representation of
	the parsed tree.  At any given call point or return point, the
	contents of the stack are expected to contain the same object
	types independently of how the instruction was reached.</p>
