-------------------

* DirectoryImporter
	- use a thread for importing
	- use exif query for width/height instead of calling identify

* DbProvider
	- add lock and command/reader wrapper to make sure that
	  multiple threads aren't accessing the db at once

* EogPreview
	- add a widget for EOG preview

* Toplevel
	- needs major cleanup and splitting into separate ui classes
	- needs to handle drag-and-drop for importing images and/or directories

* Architecture

	The repository performs too much work, a lot of it should be moved
	into the collection, there is no real need to have keyword operations
	or image operations on the repository, they should be part of the
	collection.
