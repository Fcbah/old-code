To Run sqlsharpgtk.exe

	mono sqlsharpgtk.exe

The following are minimum requirements for sqlsharpgtk:
- GTK# 1.9.3 or higher
- Mono 1.1.7 or higher
- gtk+ 2.4 or higher

Additional Assemblies:
- System.Data.dll 
- Mono.Data.dll - used for the ProviderFactory

Mono and GTK# can be downloaded from http://mono-project.com/
See README.TXT for more info.

Provider Factory:  

Either create a config file or 
add information to your machine.config
SQL# For GTK# uses the Provider Factory to load the assemblies of the providers.  
In order to do this, it needs the provider to be listed 
in sqlsharpgtk.exe.config or your machine.config file.

If you prefer to use your own config file, 
copy sqlsharpgtk.exe.config.in to sqlsharpgtk.exe.config


Works on Windows and Linux.  

It works great on Linux.

For Windows 2000/XP users, get the Combined Mono 1.1.x and GTK# 1.9.x Windows Installer
from Mono's download page.

I have heard it works on Mac OS X as well.
