To run object browser.exe you need to:
  make
  make install
  mono objectbrowser.exe

Of course you need mono, mcs, and gtk-sharp intalled properly for the above to
work.

By default, objectbrowser.exe will load and show the contents of corlib.dll, 
whereever that happens to be for your install.  If you want to browse a 
different assembly, you can provide it on the command line, such as:
  mono objectbrowser ~/some/app/i-made.exe
