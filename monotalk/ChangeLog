	item

	* ObjectBrowser/MemberRecord.cs: use patch from Gonzalo, slightly
	modified, it introduces short type aliases, I made it work with
	arrays as well and extracted to TypeAliases class with
	indexer. Also parameter names are displayed now.

	* ObjectBrowser/DemoApp.cs: load assembly from path as well as by
	name
	try LoadFrom before Load, suggested by Gonzalo

	* ObjectBrowser/ObjectBrowser.cs: show only public members by
	default, set type and flags just to 'all' factory, which forwards
	it to others

	* ObjectBrowser/MemberRecordFactory.cs: fixed Load methods to
	detect type == null, implemented AllRecordFactory::Flags property

	* ObjectBrowser/MemberRecord.cs: implemented EventRecord::Label
	prop, fixed empty constructors to play nice with fixed mcs

	* ObjectBrowser/DemoApp.cs: derive from Gnome.Program, use glade
	for UI, added View menu with scope changing check and radio items
