	* IceProtocolReader.cs: keep track of whether we've read any
	classrefs or not, and if not, don't attempt to read a count
	at the end of a message.  There is no zero count in the
	protocol if no classes are to be sent.

	* IceProtocolWriter.cs: same as above; don't write a zero
	count if there are no classes.

	* IceServerChannel.cs: listen on IPAddress.Any, instead of
	the endpoint address; the while endpoint scheme requires
	some rework.

	* samples/ping.cs, samples/ping-server.cs: rework to make
	compatible with the Ice "latency" demo
