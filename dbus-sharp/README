DBus# is a .NET language binding for glib interface to DBus.

Building & Installing DBus#:
---------------------------

    The build is the traditional:

        ./configure
        make
        make install

    You may want to consider using configure's prefix option to install
    DBus# using the same prefix as Mono.  That way all of your .NET assemblies
    get placed in the same place, and you don't need to do any extra "configuring"
    to make it so mono (and mint) can find your assemblies.  In other words,
    doing something like:

        ./configure --prefix=/your/mono/prefix
        make
        make install

    If you are compiling from CVS, you will need libtool and the auto* tools
    and will need to replace the configure above with autogen.sh.
