Gst# is a .NET language binding for the GStreamer framework.  The
Gstreamer website can be found at http://gstreamer.net/

Gst# is free software, licensed under the GNU LGPL.

Gst# relies on the GAPI tools from the Gtk# language bindings and,
hence, requires Gtk# to be installed including those tools.

Currently, nearly all of the GStreamer framework is bound; too much,
in fact. Many classes and methods which are only of any use to plugins
could and hopefully will be removed at a later date as it is
exceedingly unlikely that anyone would want to write plugins using
Gst# (for reasons of efficiency).

Building & Installing Gst#:
---------------------------

    Gst# has not been tested on Win32 but it *may* work ;)
    In the top level directory, type:

        make -f makefile.win32

    The Linux build is the traditional:

        ./configure
        make
        make install

    You may want to consider using configure's prefix option to install
    Gst# using the same prefix as Mono.  That way all of your .NET assemblies
    get placed in the same place, and you don't need to do any extra "configuring"
    to make it so mono (and mint) can find your assemblies.  In other words,
    doing something like:

        ./configure --prefix=/the/path/that/was/used/for/mono
        make
        make install

    (Of course, replace "/the/path/that/was/used/for/mono" with whatever path
    which was used for Mono.  This might have been "/usr", "/usr/local", or
    something similar.)

    If you are compiling from CVS, you will need libtool and the auto* tools
    and will need to replace the configure above with autogen.sh.


Discussion & Support:
---------------------

    Since this is a spin-off from the Gtk# package then discussion and
    support should probably take place on the Gtk# mailing list.

    You can subscribe to the mailing list by visiting:

        http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/gtk-sharp-list

    And following the instructions (on that page) to subscribe.
    Messages are posted on this mailing list by sending them to:

        gtk-sharp-list@ximian.com

    (The mailing list requires you to subscribe in order to post
    messages.)

    An archive of this mailing list can be found at:

        http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/gtk-sharp-list/

    Further, a Wiki is available for Gtk#, and can be found at:

        http://www.nullenvoid.com/gtksharp/wiki/

    Also, people can get help with and discuss Gtk# on IRC via the
    #mono channel on the irc.gnome.org IRC server.

    People looking for general help with C# should visit the
    #c# channel on irc.freenode.net IRC server.


Developers:
-----------

    There is currently little available in the way of Gst#
    documentation for developers. The GStreamer API documentation
    available online at the GStreamer website (see URL above) is
    useful however as, although it refers to the original C library,
    the function calls generally map to method calls in the Gst#
    classes.

    Additionally, there is a small sample in the sample directory
    which illustrates basic MP3 playback. Note that it requires the mad
    plugin to be installed (type gst-inspect to see a list of
    installed plugins)


Hackers:
--------

    For those who wish to help with the development of Gst#, they should
    read the file named: HACKING.
