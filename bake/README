Bake is a make replacement written in Boo. Bakefiles replace Makefiles, and
are also written in Boo. The concept of targets, dependencies, and actions
make up the core of Bake, just like make.

Bake has a full function library including many helper functions and targets 
for building Mono/.NET projects.


Building Bake
=============

Bake is able to build itself, but Bake is simple enough that typically we
just build it with make to avoid bootstrap overhead. Therefore, to build
Bake, just type "make".

To bootstrap Bake however, run "make", and then source in the bakestrap file
into BASH:

$ make
$ . bakestrap
$ touch src/Bake/Bake.boo
$ bake
