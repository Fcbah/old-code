* New TODO list

        NOTE: Please edit only the docs in new/, as that's the 
	version of Monkeyguide which will go forward.

	Embedding guide is missing.
		Add makefile/something to integrate it.

	See the porting-old-monkeyguide notes below for an itemized
	list of what content's been moved from the old monkeyguide into
	the new one. (Shane Landrum, epicene@pobox.com)

	Roll in contents of monodoc tutorial at
	http://people.mosaix.net/chris/tutorials/monodoc/monodoc-tutorial.html  
	(mostly done)

	
* Monkey Guide TODO List

	The Monkey Guide is a tutorial about the Mono platform.
	It focuses in the main routines and its basical use:

	* Installation guide
	* Mono commands
	* Languages tutorial (C#/MonoBASIC/etc)
	* Corlib API tutorial

	However, this guide needs to be updated and needs to be
	completed. The main tasks about it are:

	* Remove all the empty sections - A lot of empty sections can
	confuse new mono users, so it is neccesary to delete the
	empty sections from the guide .

	* Remove the useless nested structure - It is hard for the new users
	to find a section inside the guide, this caused by the fact that
	are too much nested section. Find a *good* structure to make it easy to
	read/search.

	* Write introductions to the chapters - An introduction to the
	chapter will clarify the things to new users.
	
	* Separate Gnome.NET tutorial - Separate it from the Monkey guide since
	it trends to confuse the users and it is good enough to be
	separated from the rest of the guide.

	Contact the list to check for users working on the same section (it is useless
	to write documentation already written).

NOTES ON PORTING:

html/en is the contents of the old Monkeyguide; this is a list of the full
contents, along with notes about how things have been ported 
(or not ported, as the case may be.)

Symbols key:
  - Files preceded by * have been ported properly into the contents of
    new/en. (This occasionally means that their information has been
    rolled into other files.)
  - Files preceded by W are "won't-port" files. 
  - Files preceded by ? are "might-port" files.
  - Files preceded by T are "to-be-ported" files.

This list is under construction.
