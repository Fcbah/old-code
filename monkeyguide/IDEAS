For build system

1. Make obsolete monkeyguide as "old" and just shift new stuff as current.

2. To make translation easy, we should avoid "en" dependent part of makefile.

   1. (done) To make it possible, add make target that takes locale like

	make LOCALE=ja

      which defaults to "en".

   2. (done) To build translated documents effectively, it should avoid to
      clone all the documents in one new/blah/ directory. Non-translations
      are pulled from "en".

   3. toc2.xml should be localizable (doc title is English).

1. Some of the things you need (samples); can be re-used from the /sample
   directory in the gtk-sharp module. At least that is a start! :)

2. My suggestion is to make a small application that would show 
   programmers how to build a full application, pick a target application
   (for example you could pick the `same-gnome' game) and build it from
   zero:
   1.  Creating your UI using glade.
   2.  Connecting the Glade code to C#
   3.  Making the program go.
   4.  Using the Canvas/Drawing.
   5.  Creating a configuration dialog box with Glade.
   6.  Loading configuration settings from GConf.
   7.  Storing scores on a database.
   8.  Internationalization.
   9.  Adding an About Box and a logo
   10. Making the executable self-contained
   11. Creating a custom widget.

4. How to author a custom widget.        
   * Highlight things like anFocus' property.        
   * Handling keyboard events.
   * Repainting.
