<h3>Data Access in Mono</h3>

<p>Mono can interact with a variety of commercial and open source
    databases using ADO.NET. The project's current goal for data access 
    is to be compatible with .NET 1.1 and .NET 1.0.
    We also would like to extend data access beyond what is included
    with .NET 1.0 and .NET 1.1, such as, include access to more
    databases, such as, PostgreSQL and MySQL, but also provide classes
    that help in creating data source-agnostic code, such as,
    Mono.Data.ProviderFactory.
</p><p>
    In the future, we would like to be compatible with .NET 1.2.
    This includes features like <a href=

</p>

<p>This document does not aim to be a tutorial on ADO.NET, since there
are many fine books and online resources that can help you.</p>

<!-- FIXME: this should go somewhere else -->
<h3>Bugs and Feature Requests</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Bugs with Mono or any data provider in Mono should be reported
    in Mono's Bugzilla <a href="http://bugzilla.ximian.com/">here</a>.
    If you do not have a Bugzilla user account, it is free and easy to
    create one <a href=
		  "http://bugzilla.ximian.com/createaccount.cgi">here</a>.</li>
  <li>Any requests for new features or missing functionality can
    entered as a bug in Bugzilla too</li>
</ul>
