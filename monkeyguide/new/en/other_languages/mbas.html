<h1>mbas: Mono's VisualBasic.NET Compiler.</h1>
MonoBASIC (mbas) is a CIL compiler for the VisualBasic.NET
language, an extended version of Visual Basic. It's based on the
MCS compiler and still in heavy development, though many language
features are already supported. See mcs/mbas/
<h3>What works</h3>
<ul>
<li>Classes, Fields and Methods. Properties are still being worked
on.</li>
<li>Module definition and Sub/Function functionality * Namespace
Import, so can you reference, instantiate and call external
assemblies</li>
<li>Parameter passing between Sub's. ByVal and ByRef parameters are
being worked on.</li>
<li>Delegates</li>
<li>Object creation</li>
<li>Events - to a limited extent. You can declare a Class-Field as
'WithEvents' and dynamic events (i.e AddHandler MyButton.Click,
Button1_OnClick). Please beware: just after committing the code, I
discovered that the handler field in the AddHandler call is
case-sensitive, a remnant of mBas' mcs heritage)</li>
<li>Statements supported are 'If..Then..Else' , 'While..End While'
and assignment statements. Simple operators (+, -, *, /, &gt;,
&lt;, =) should also work. Other statements (For..Next, etc.)
should be quite trivial to implement.</li>
</ul>
A lot of this stuff is implemented rebuilding proper expressions
and statements on top of the classes based on those of mcs (look at
the grammar - mb-parser.jay - and compare it with cs-parser.jay, if
interested), but some are getting deeply changed, to better conform
to VB.NET semantics.
<h3>TODO-list</h3>
At this stage almost every element of the language must be still
checked for conformance to MS' implementation. We'd like to
implement the missing statements, exception handling, structures
and actual event support (not necessarily in this order). Once we
have all this stuff set up and reasonably bug-free, more work could
be done on helper functions and Object-vars handling.
<p>Also work on the supporting library (we don't currently depend
on it as much as MS vbc-compiled programs, but especially for
late-binding scenarios we will) is surely needed: it's in
mcs/class/Microsoft.VisualBasic/</p>
