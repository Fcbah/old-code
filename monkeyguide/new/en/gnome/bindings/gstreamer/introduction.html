GStreamer is a framework for creating streaming media applications.
The fundamental design comes from the video pipeline at Oregon
Graduate Institute, as well as some ideas from DirectShow. 
<p>GStreamer's development framework makes it possible to write any
type of streaming multimedia application. The GStreamer framework
is designed to make it easy to write applications that handle
either audio or video or both. The pipeline design is made to have
no extra overhead above what the applied filters induce. This makes
GStreamer a good framework for designing even high-end audio
applications which puts high demands on latency.</p>
<p>One of the the most obvious uses of GStreamer is using it to
build a media player. GStreamer already includes components for
building a media player that can support a very wide variety of
formats, including MP3, Ogg Vorbis, MPEG1, MPEG2, AVI, Quicktime,
mod and so on. GStreamer, however, is much more than just another
media player. Its main advantages are that the pluggable components
can be mixed and matched into arbitrary pipelines so that it's
possible to write a full-fledged video or audio editing
application.</p>
<p>The framework is based on plugins that will provide the various
codec and other functionality. The plugins can be connected and
arranged in a pipeline. This pipeline defines the flow of the data.
Pipelines can also be edited with a GUI editor and saved as XML so
that pipeline libraries can be made with a minimum of effort.</p>
<p>The GStreamer core function is to provide a framework for
plugins, data flow and media type handling/negotiation. It also
provides an API to write applications using the various
plugins.</p>
<p>This book is about GStreamer from a developer's point of view;
it describes how to write a GStreamer application using the
GStreamer libraries and tools. For an explanation about writing
plugins, we suggest the Plugin Writers Guide.</p>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<h4>Multitude of duplicate code</h4>
The Linux user who wishes to hear a sound file must hunt through
their collection of sound file players in order to play the tens of
sound file formats in wide use today. Most of these players
basically reimplement the same code over and over again. 
<p>The Linux developer who wishes to embed a video clip in their
application must use crude hacks to run an external video player.
There is no library available that a developer can use to create a
custom media player.</p>
<h4>'One goal' media players/libraries</h4>
Your typical MPEG player was designed to play MPEG video and audio.
Most of these players have implemented a complete infrastructure
focused on achieving their only goal: playback. No provisions were
made to add filters or special effects to the video or audio data. 
<p>If I wanted to convert an MPEG2 video stream into an AVI file,
my best option would be to take all of the MPEG2 decoding
algorithms out of the player and duplicate them into my own AVI
encoder. These algorithms cannot easily be shared accross
applications.</p>
<p>Attempts have been made to create libraries for handling various
media types. Because they focus on a very specific media type
(avifile, libmpeg2, ...), significant work is needed to integrate
them due to a lack of a common API. GStreamer allows you to wrap
these libraries with a common API, which significantly simplifies
integration and reuse.</p>
<h4>Non unified plugin mechanisms</h4>
Your typical media player might have a plugin for different media
types. Two media players will typically implement their own plugin
mechanism so that the codecs cannot be easily exchanged. The plugin
system of the typical media player is also very tailored to the
specific needs of the application. 
<p>The lack of a unified plugin mechanism also seriously hinders
the creation of binary only codecs. No company is willing to port
their code to all the different plugin mechanisms.</p>
<p>While GStreamer also uses it own plugin system it offers a very
rich framework for the plugin developper and ensures the plugin can
be used in a wide range of applications, transparently interacting
with other plugins. The Framework that GStreamer provides for the
plugins is flexible enough to host even the most demanding
plugins.</p>
<h4>Provision for network transparency</h4>
No infrastructure is present to allow network transparent media
handling. A distributed MPEG encoder will typically duplicate the
same encoder algorithms found in a non-distributed encoder. 
<p>No provisions have been made for emerging technologies such as
the GNOME object embedding using Bonobo.</p>
<p>The GStreamer cores does not use network transparent
technologies at the lowest level as it only adds overhead for the
local case. That said, it shouldn't be hard to create a wrapper
around the core components.</p>
<h4>Catch up with the Windows(tm) world</h4>
We need solid media handling if we want to see Linux succeed on the
desktop. 
<p>We must clear the road for commercially backed codecs and
multimedia applications so that Linux can become an option for
doing multimedia.</p>
