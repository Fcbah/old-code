<p>Range widgets ((<a href="T:Gtk.Range">Gtk.Range</a>) are your
standard, run-of-the-mill scrollbars. These should be used only for
scrolling some other widget, such as a list, a text box, or a viewport
(and it's generally easier to use the scrolled window widget in most
cases). For other purposes, you should use scale widgets, as they are
friendlier and more featureful.</p>

<p>There are separate types for horizontal and vertical scrollbars.
There really isn't much to say about these. You create them with
the following functions:</p>

<pre class="code">
HScrollbar hscrollbar1 = new HScrollbar( Adjustment adjustment );
VScrollbar vscrollbar1 = new VScrollbar( Adjustment adjustment );
</pre>

and that's about it. The adjustment argument can either be a pointer to an
existing Adjustment, or NULL, in which case one will be created for
you. Specifying NULL might actually be useful in this case, if you
wish to pass the newly-created adjustment to the constructor
function of some other widget which will configure it for you, such
as a text widget.
