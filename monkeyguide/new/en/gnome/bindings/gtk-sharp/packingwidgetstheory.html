If you've worked a lot with Windows GUI programming, you're probably
used to positioning widgets using coordinates. Although this is
possible with Gtk#, the preferred way of aligning widgets is with
boxes. Boxes are invisible widget containers. They come in two forms:
horizontal (HBox) and vertical (VBox). While this is more difficult
for a newcomer, it has some advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Independent of screensize</li>
<li>Easier Internationalization</li></ul>

<p><a href="T:Gtk.HBox">HBox</a> and <a href="T:Gtk.VBox">VBox</a> objects 
work similarly to Button objects or any other widget. After you've
laid out an HBox or VBox, be sure to call one of the packing methods
to set up the box. 
</p>

<p>For a VBox, PackStart will pack the box starting at the top, and
PackEnd will pack it starting at the bottom. For an HBox, PackStart will
pack the box from left to right, and PackEnd will pack it right to left.
</p>

<p>PackStart and PackEnd tell Gtk# where you want to place your
widgets; the library will handle automatic resizing and other nifty things.
There are also a number of options as to how your widgets should be
packed; read the API documentation for HBox and VBox for more details.
The resulting layout system is significantly more flexible than pixel-by-pixel
coordinate layouts.</p>
