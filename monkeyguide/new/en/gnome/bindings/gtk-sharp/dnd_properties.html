<p>Drag data has the following properties:</p>

<ul>
<li>Drag action type(s) from <a href="T:Gdk.DragAction"/>.</li>

<li>Client specified arbitrary drag-and-drop type (a name and number
pair).</li>

<li>Sent and received data format type.</li>
</ul>

<p>Drag actions are quite obvious, they specify if the widget can drag
with the specified action(s), e.g. <a
href="M:Gdk.DragAction.Move">Gdk.DragAction.Move</a> and/or <a
href="M:Gdk.DragAction.Copy">Gdk.DragAction.Copy</a>. A <a
href="M:Gdk.DragAction.Move">Gdk.DragAction.Move</a> would be a
typical drag-and-drop without the source data being deleted while <a
href="M:Gdk.DragAction.Move">Gdk.DragAction.Move</a> would be just
like <a href="M:Gdk.DragAction.Copy">Gdk.DragAction.Copy</a> but the
source data will be 'suggested' to be deleted after the received
signal handler is called. There are additional drag actions
including <a href="M:Gdk.DragAction.Link">Gdk.DragAction.Link</a>
which you may want to look into when you get to more advanced levels
of drag-and-drop.</p>

<p>The client specified arbitrary drag-and-drop type is much more
flexible, because your application will be defining and checking for
that specifically. You will need to set up your destination widgets to
receive certain drag-and-drop types by specifying a name and/or
number. It's much more reliable to use a name since another
application may happen to use the same number for an entirely
different meaning.</p>

<p>Sent and received data format types come into play only in your
request and received data handler functions.  (This is also called the
"selection target", though that term is a holdover from GTK+.) is
merely the data format (i.e. <a href="T:Gdk.Atom">Gdk.Atom</a>,
integer, or string) being sent or received. Your request data handler
function needs to specify the type of data that it sends out and your
received data handler needs to handle the type of data received.</p>
