<p>The general steps to creating a widget in Gtk# are:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. new Gtk.*() - one of various functions to create a new
widget. These are all detailed in this section.</li>
<li>2. Connect all signals and events we wish to use to the
appropriate handlers.</li>
<li>3. Set the attributes of the widget.</li>
<li>4. Pack the widget into a container using the appropriate call
such as <a href="M:Gtk.Container.Add">Gtk.Container.Add</a> 
or <a href="M:Gtk.Box.PackStart">Gtk.Box.PackStart</a> (or its HBox or VBox
incarnation).</li>
<li>5. Show() the widget.</li>
<li>6. Show() lets Gtk# know that we are done setting the
attributes of the widget, and it is ready to be displayed. You may
also use Hide() to make it disappear again. The order in
which you show the widgets is not important, but it's best to show
the window last so the whole window pops up at once rather than
seeing the individual widgets come up on the screen as they're
formed. A window is a widget too; the children of a widget will
not be displayed until the window itself is shown using the
Show() method.</li></ul>
