<p>Scale widgets are used to allow the user to visually select and
manipulate a value within a specific range. You might want to use a
scale widget, for example, to adjust the magnification level on a
zoomed preview of a picture, or to control the brightness of a
color, or to specify the number of minutes of inactivity before a
screensaver takes over the screen.</p>

<a name="creating"><h3>Creating a Scale Widget</h3></a >

<p>As with scrollbars, there are separate widget types for horizontal and
vertical scale widgets (see <a href="T:Gtk.HScale">Gtk.HScale</a>
and <a href="T:Gtk.VScale">Gtk.VScale</a> ). (Most programmers seem to
favor horizontal scale widgets.) Since they work essentially the same
way, there's no need to treat them separately here. The following
functions create vertical and horizontal scale widgets, respectively:

<pre class="code">
VScale vscale1 = new VScale(Adjustment adjustment );

VScale vscale2 = new VScaleWithRange(double min,
                                     double max,
                                     double step );

HScale hscale1 = new HScale(Adjustment adjustment );

HScale hscale2 = new HScaleWithRange(double min,
                                     double max,
                                     double step );
</pre>

The adjustment argument can either be an adjustment object which
has already been created, or "null", in which case, an anonymous
<a href="T:Gtk.Adjustment">Gtk.Adjustment</a> is created with all of
its values set to 0.0 (which isn't very useful in this case). In order
to avoid confusing yourself, you probably want to create your
adjustment with a page_size of 0.0 so that its upper value actually
corresponds to the highest value the user can select. The WithRange
constructor variants take care of creating a suitable adjustment
object. (If you're already thoroughly confused, read the section on
Adjustments again for an explanation of what exactly adjustments do
and how to create and manipulate them; also read the <a
href="T:Gtk.Adjustment">Gtk.Adjustment</a> docs.)
</p>

<a name="creating"><h3>Functions and Signals</h3></a> 

<p>
Scale widgets can display their current value as a number beside
the trough. The default behavior is to show the value, but you can
change this with this function: 
<pre class="code">
vscale1.DrawValue = bool draw_value;
</pre>
As you might have guessed, <i>draw_value</i> is either true or false,
with predictable consequences for either one. 
</p>

<p>The value displayed by a scale widget is rounded to one decimal
point by default, as is the value field in its Adjustment. You can
change this with:
<pre class="code">
vscale1.Digits = int digits;
</pre>
where digits is the number of decimal places you want. You can set
digits to anything you like, but no more than 13 decimal places
will actually be drawn on screen. </p>

<p>Finally, the value can be drawn in different positions relative
to the trough:</p>
<pre class="code">
vscale1.ValuePos = PositionType  pos;
</pre>

<p>
The argument <i>pos</i> is of type <a
href="T:Gtk.PositionType">Gtk.PositionType</a>, which can take one of
the following values:
<pre class="code">
  Gtk.PositionType.Left
  Gtk.PositionType.Right
  Gtk.PositionType.Top
  Gtk.PositionType.Bottom
</pre>
If you position the value on the "side" of the trough (e.g., on the
top or bottom of a horizontal scale widget), then it will follow
the slider up and down the trough. 
</p>

<a href="T:Gtk.HScale">Gtk.HScale</a> and <a href="T:Gtk.VScale">Gtk.VScale</a>.
