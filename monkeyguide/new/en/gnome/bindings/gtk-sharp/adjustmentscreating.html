<p>Many of the widgets which use adjustment objects do so
automatically, but some cases will be shown in later examples where
you may need to create one yourself. You create an adjustment
using:</p>

<pre class="code">
Gtk.Object adjustment = new Adjustment( double value,
                               double lower,
                               double upper,
                               double step_increment,
                               double page_increment,
                               double page_size );
</pre>

The value argument is the initial value you want to give to the
adjustment, usually corresponding to the topmost or leftmost
position of an adjustable widget. The lower argument specifies the
lowest value which the adjustment can hold. The step_increment
argument specifies the "smaller" of the two increments by which the
user can change the value, while the page_increment is the "larger"
one. The page_size argument usually corresponds somehow to the
visible area of a panning widget. The upper argument is used to
represent the bottom most or right most coordinate in a panning
widget's child. Therefore it is not always the largest number that
value can take, since the page_size of such widgets is usually
non-zero.
