Because the Gtk# packing system is so flexible, it can be confusing
at first. In the end, however, there are basically five different styles
of packing. 
<p><img src="packbox.png" border="0" /></p>

<p>In the image above, each line contains one horizontal box (HBox) with several
buttons. The call to Pack() is shorthand for the call to pack each
of the buttons into the HBox. Each of the buttons is packed into
the HBox the same way (i.e., same arguments to the PackStart()
method).</p>
<p>This is the declaration of the PackStart() method.</p>
<pre class="code">
box1.PackStart(     Widget child,
                    bool   expand,
                    bool   fill,
                    int    padding);
</pre>
The first argument is object you want to pack into the box. The
objects will all be buttons for now, so we'll be packing buttons
into boxes. 
<p>The expand argument to PackStart() and PackEnd() controls
whether the widgets are laid out in the box to fill in all the
extra space in the box so the box is expanded to fill the area
allotted to it (true); or the box is shrunk to just fit the widgets
(false). Setting expand to false will allow you to do right and
left justification of your widgets. Otherwise, they will all expand
to fit into the box, and the same effect could be achieved by using
only one of PackStart() or PackEnd().</p>

<p>The fill argument to the Pack() functions control whether the
extra space is allocated to the objects themselves (true), or as
extra padding in the box around these objects (false). It only has
an effect if the expand argument is also true.</p>

<p>When creating a new box, the function looks like this:</p>

<pre class="code">
Widget hbox1 = new HBox(     bool homogeneous,
                             int  spacing );
</pre>

The homogeneous argument to HBox() (and the same for VBox())
controls whether each object in the box has the same size (i.e.,
the same width in an HBox, or the same height in a vbox). If it is
set, the Pack() routines function essentially as if the expand
argument was always turned on. 

<p>What's the difference between spacing (set when the box is
created) and padding (set when elements are packed)? Spacing is
added between objects, and padding is added on either side of an
object. The following figure should make it clearer:</p>
