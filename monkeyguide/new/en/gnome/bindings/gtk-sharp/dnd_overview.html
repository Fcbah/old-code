<p>An application capable of Gtk# drag-and-drop (DND) first defines and
sets up the GTK+ widget(s) for DND. Each widget can be a
source and/or destination for particular types of DND data. (Note that these GTK+
widgets must have an associated X Window; check this using 
<see cref="F:Gtk.WidgetFlags.NoWindow" />.</p>

<p>Source widgets can send out drag data, thus allowing the user to
drag things from them, while destination widgets can receive drag
data. DND destinations can limit who they accept drag
data from, e.g. the same application or any application (including
itself).</p>

<p>Sending and receiving drop data makes use of Gtk# signals.
Dropping an item to a destination widget requires both a data
request (for the source widget) and data received signal handler
(for the target widget). Additional signal handers can be connected
if you want to know when a drag begins (at the very instant it
starts), to when a drop is made, and when the entire drag-and-drop
procedure has ended (successfully or not).</p>

<p>Every source widget must have a signal handler that provides
data when requested. Every destination widget needs a signal handler
that handles data dropped onto it. These two handlers are the
core of DND functionality for developers.</p>

<p>A typical drag-and-drop cycle looks like this:</p>
<p>1. Drag begins.</p>
<p>2. Drag data request (when a drop occurs).</p>
<p>3. Drop data received (may be on same or different
application).</p>
<p>4. Drag data delete (if the drag was a move).</p>
<p>5. Drag-and-drop procedure done.</p>

<p>There are a few minor steps that go in between here and there,
but we will get into detail about that later.</p>
