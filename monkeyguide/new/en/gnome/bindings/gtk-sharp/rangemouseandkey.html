<p>All of the Gtk range widgets react to mouse clicks in more or
less the same way. Clicking button-1 in the trough will cause its
adjustment's <i>page_increment</i> to be added or subtracted from its
value, and the slider to be moved accordingly. Clicking mouse
button-2 in the trough will jump the slider to the point at which
the button was clicked. Clicking button-3 in the trough of a range
or any button on a scrollbar's arrows will cause its adjustment's
value to change by <i>step_increment</i> at a time.</p>

<p>Scrollbars are not focusable; thus, they have no key bindings. The
key bindings for the other range widgets (which are, of course, only
active when the widget has focus) do not differentiate between
horizontal and vertical range widgets.</p>

<p>All range widgets can be operated with the left, right, up and
down arrow keys, as well as with the Page Up and Page Down keys.
The arrows move the slider up and down by <i>step_increment</i>, while
Page Up and Page Down move it by <i>page_increment</i>.</p>

-<p>The user can also move the slider all the way to one end or the
other of the trough using the keyboard. This is done with the Home
and End keys.</p>
