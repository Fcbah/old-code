This document is designed to get you started quickly with Mono and Gtk#.
Depending on your background, this may mean different things. It assumes that
you're already familiar with GUI programming on some platform. It's targeted
largely at GUI development, but it also covers ASP.NET programming with Mono.
</p>

<p>For starters, read the <a href="mono/mono.html">first chapter about Mono</a>; it's a business
and technology introduction. If most of your experience is with 
UNIX or Linux and X11 GUIs, you'll do best to start
with the chapter on <a href="for_linux_developers/intro.html">Mono for Linux
developers.</a> If you've programmed GUIs on Windows before and have some
.NET experience, start with the chapter on 
<a href="for_windows_developers/intro.html">Mono for Windows developers</a>.
These chapters are tailored for particular kinds of experience; the rest should
be useful no matter your background.
</p>

<p>
Finally, this document is a high-points overview of how to use Mono. If you'd
like a slower and more point-by-point lab-style tutorial, you may
want to read <i>Mono: A Developer's Notebook</i> by Edd Dumbill and Niel
Bornstein, ISBN 0-596-00792-2.
