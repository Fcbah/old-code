<h1>Introduction</h1>

<h2>What is XML?</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/">XML</a> (e<b>X</b>tensible <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage) is a Web
Standard formed by the W3C (<a href="http://www.w3.org/">the World Wide Web Consortium</a>).</p>

<p>It is widely used in several formats, such as a data file, document 
file, or message transfer. For example XHTML is one, or an Office file 
format (all OpenOffice.org files are Xml). There are lots of tools and 
APIs available to deal with xml. XML can be easily edited by hand. 
XML is so semi-structured data format that it is flexible enough
to be convertible to another system.</p>

<p>Microsoft has claimed, that Xml would be a central file format
in .NET. Entsprechend big is the class library offered to work with Xml.</p>


<h2>Pgoramming XML in .NET</h2>

<p>We provide several XML manipulating API, which almost come from .NET Framework, such as:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Read and validate XML documents using XML Reader</li>
	<li>Write XML documents using XML Writer</li>
	<li>Manipulate XML document sutucture with Document Object Model</li>
	<li>Build XML document sutucture with XML Schema</li>
	<li>Convert structured XML documents into CLR Types with XML Serializer</li>
	<li>Traverse XML documents with XPath and XPathNavigator, a very powerful Query language.</li>
	<li>Transform XML documents into another XML document, with an XSLT stylesheet and XslTransform</li>
	<li>Treat XML documents as a set of data tables with ADO.NET</li>
</ul>

<p>We support almost all what Microsoft.NET Framework provides implemented in
System.XML.dll. We also support many ADO.NET classes as well.</p>


<h2>Common Terminology</h2>

<p>Sometimes we regard XML as a tree structures which consists of several
"nodes." See <a 
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-DOM-Level-2-Core-20001113/core.html#ID-1590626202">the DOM structure model</a>, which provides almost the same
notion of "node" here.</p>

<p>Sometimes we use "XML Information Set", "Information Set", or abbreviated
"infoset" as representing information of nodes. Basically it is the same as 
W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-infoset/">XML Information Set
Recommendation</a>.</p>
