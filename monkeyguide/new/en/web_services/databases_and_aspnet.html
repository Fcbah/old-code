<h3>Database Access from ASP.NET</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Take a look at xsp in cvs and look at the examples in test:
    dbpage1.aspx and dbpage2.aspx:
    <ul>
      <li>Notice that the namespace System.Data is imported via
	<b>import</b></li>
      <li>A NameValueCollection is gotten using
	ConfigurationSettings.AppSetings. These settings are gotten from
	the file server.exe.config which is a XML file. The XML file has a
	section appSettings. In the appSettings section, you have keys for
	DBProviderAssembly, DBConnectionType, and DBConnectionString.
	<ul>
	  <li><b>DBProviderAssembly</b> is the assembly of the ADO.NET
	    provider. For example: "ByteFX.Data"</li>
	  <li><b>DBConnectionType</b> is the System.Type of the class that
	    implements System.Data.IDbConnection that is found in the
	    DBProviderAssembly. For example: "ByteFX.Data.MySqlConnection"</li>
	  <li><b>DBConnectionString</b> is the ConnectionString to set to the
	    IDbConnection object to use in opening a connection to a data
	    source. For Example:
	    "hostaddr=127.0.0.1;user=monotest;password=monotest;dbname=monotest"</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>The function GetConnectionData() gets the database provider
	assembly, connection type, and connection string parameters if they
	exist; otherwise, it uses default values. This is done during the
	loading of the web page.</li>
      <li>With the connection parameters, the assembly is loaded, the
	connection type is verified that it implements IDbConnection and an
	instance of the class can be created, creates a instance of the
	class, sets the connection string, and opens the connection.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
