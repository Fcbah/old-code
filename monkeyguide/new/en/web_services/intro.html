<p>
Using Mono, you can build ASP web applications using Linux or Windows 
without losing the flexibility and power of Apache. Mono's ASP.NET 
implementation has two major components:

<ul>
  <li>XSP, a standalone webserver that hosts ASP.NET's System.Web classes</li>
  <li>mod_mono, an Apache module that ties XSP and Apache together</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
These tools allow you to build infrastructure for web applications (code
for which the primary interface is pointing and clicking on a webpage) and
for web services (SOAP-based RPC systems). They work with many
publicly-available .NET applications, and the underlying web services stack
is used in several commercial applications.
</p>

<p>
If you want to write your own webserver, the class libraries will support this,
though that is an advanced topic out of the scope of this document.
