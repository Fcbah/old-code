<h3>Getting the tools</h3>

<p>
The Mono tools for web applications are available from the 
<a href="http://www.mono-project.com/downloads/index.html">Mono downloads
page</a>. For the exercises described in this section, you'll
need both the XSP package and the mod_mono package. Download them
and install them as appropriate on your platform. <i>Note: As of August
15, 2004, mod_mono does not run on Windows.</i>
</p>

<p>XSP and mod_mono are also available via CVS if you want to work with
the bleeding-edge versions to help with ongoing development.</p>

<h3>XSP</h3>

<p>XSP is a simple web server written in C# that can be used to run your
ASP.NET applications. You can use the MonoWorkerRequest and MonoApplicationHost
modules that ship with XSP to make Apache modules using Mono.
XSP also supports gzip HTTP transfers courtesy of several plugins that
ship with Mono.
</p>

<p>There is also a set of pages, controls and web services that you
can use to test the server and see how ASP.NET looks like.</p>

<p>As XSP is written in C# and uses System.Web classes to perform its
job, it also works under the MS runtime engine.  </p>

<h3>mod_mono</h3>

<p>mod_mono is a module for Apache that will allow Apache to interface with
XSP.</p>
