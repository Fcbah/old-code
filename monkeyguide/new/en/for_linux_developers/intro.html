If you've read this far, you know that Mono promises to make it easier to
build Linux applications. Here are the gritty details you need to know
before working with code.

<h3>Language independence</h3>

<p>Mono and .NET both compile source code into a language-independent
bytecode called CIL (Common Intermediate Language). You can write .NET applications 
in any language that you want, so long as there's a CIL compiler for them.
The Common Language Runtime (CLR) runs CIL generated by any language; it contains
a just-in-time (JIT) compiler to convert CIL to machine language at runtime. 
</p>

<p>
The CLR  uses a common type system so that types will be portable across 
applications written in different languages. Because of this, .NET-specific 
libraries are required in each language.
</p>

<p>(FIXME: This shouldn't be too introductory, but should cover enough
of the major points to be useful.)</p>
