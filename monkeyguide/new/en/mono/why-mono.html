<h2>Mono and Linux Adoption</h2>

<p>Companies who haven't adopted Linux often cite the lack of Linux
  applications as a reason. In turn, the small number of Linux applications
  is related to the existing development tools and the size of the developer
  base. Although Linux is hugely successful to run
  server applications it has not thrived as a platform for developers
  of desktop software. The Mono project exists to change this.
  We want to make it easy for the huge number of Windows developers
  to build Linux applications.
</p>

<p>Currently, Windows-based developers moving to Linux have a huge
  learning curve. They have to face a  new environment, a new set 
  of APIs, the lack of portability for any of their code, an unfamiliar 
  set of tools and a disparate and non-coherent development platform.
  They're used to tools like MS Visual Studio, which requires engineers
  to work in a very different way than vi or Emacs and a command-line
  compiler. 
</p>

<p>The Open Source culture does not take binary nor backwards
  compatibility particularly seriously, but the corporate world sees 
  things differently. This is something that software companies have to
  take very seriously if we want developers to use Linux: software
  developed today should run in 20 years without modification.</p>

<p>.NET -and by extension Mono- have been designed to work in this 
  situation.</p>


<h2>Mono and Linux adoption: Server</h2>

<b>
  Goals:
  <ul>
    <li>Deploy ASP.NET web servers and web services on Linux.</li>
    <li>Leverage Linux security, reliability and low cost.</li>
    <li>Reuse third-party controls, components and applications on
  Linux.</li>
  </ul>
</b>

<p>Mono enables developers to bring server-side applications that
  have been developed with the Microsoft .NET Framework over to Unix
  servers.</p>

<p>Today Windows users have a choice of platform for
  enterprise applications: Sun's J2EE platform and Microsoft's .NET
  platform, while Linux/Unix users have been limited to only Sun's
  J2EE platform.</p>

<p>With Mono, Windows developers can use existing development
  tools and deploy on clusters of Linux servers.  </p>

<h2>Mono and Linux adoption: Desktop</h2>

<b>
  Goals:
  <ul>
    <li>Increase development productivity.</li>
    <li>Bring Windows ISVs to Linux Desktop.</li>
    <li>Reuse third-party tools, controls, components and applications on Linux.</li>
    <li>Support both Windows and Linux: share code.</li>
  </ul>
</b>

<p>The success of the Linux platform is tied to having an
  encompassing development platform.</p>

<p>Unlike the server side where the development platform is fairly
  complete, Linux client side development is relatively weak. Either it
  is not as mature, or the fragmentation of libraries has made it 
  very hard to have a unified development stack.  Various libraries 
  can be used to build applications but the result is a very diverse 
  quilt of technologies and methodologies, often leading to instabilities, 
  dependencies and wasted hours of debugging time.</p>

<p>The Mono platform has one advantage: since it is relatively new
  it has been able to absorb all of today's needs into a unified
  platform with a unified programming model and brings a lot of
  clarity to today's development platform.  </p>

<p>Mono's advanced runtime gives developers many features for free:
  automatic garbage collection, thread safety, and safety from buffer
  overflows and other sources of security exploits.</p>

<p>The C# language incorporates various concepts that are normally
  used in GUI application development directly into the language as
  first-class language constructs like events, delegates, properties
  and attributes.</p>

<p>The addition of Visual Basic and Windows.Forms (Q4/2004) to Mono
  will also help migrate this important group of developers from the
  Windows platform to Linux.</p>
