<h1>.NET Framework Architecture</h1>
<h2>The Big Picture</h2>

<p>
  When approaching something as complex as .NET, it helps to have
  some idea of how it relates to your work. The following diagram
  provides some context for where your application fits into the Mono/.NET 
  framework.
</p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">NOTE: This is a greatly simplified
  view; we're ignoring ASP.NET and ADO.NET for now.</div>

<p>Refer to the above diagram for the following sections.</p>

<h2><a name="Class_Library" id="Class_Library"></a>Class
  Library</h2>

<p>The class library provides a comprehensive set of facilities for
  application development. Primarily written in C#, it can be used by
  any language, thanks to the
  <span style="font-style: italic;">Common Language
    Specification</span>.
</p>
<p>The class library is structured into
  <span style="font-style: italic;">Namespaces,</span> and deployed
  in shared libraries known as
  <span style="font-style: italic;">Assemblies.</span><br />
  When we speak of the .NET framework , we are primarily referring to
  this class library.<br />
</p>

<h3><a name="Namespaces" id="Namespaces"></a>Namespaces</h3>

<p>Namespaces are a mechanism for logically grouping similar
  classes into a hierarchical structure. This prevents naming
  conflicts. The structure is implemented using dot-separated words.
  The top level namespace for most of the .NET framework is
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">System</span>. Under the System
  namespace you'll find the following:<br /></p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>System.IO</li>
    <li>System.Net</li>
    <li>System.Net.Sockets</li>
    <li>System.Reflection</li>
    <li>System.Threading</li>
    <li>...and many others. For a complete list, see the
      <a href="http://go-mono.com/class-status.html">Mono class library
	status page</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  There are other top-level namespaces as well;
  <span style="font-style: italic;">Accessibility</span>, and
  <span style="font-style: italic;">Windows</span> are examples. You
  can also create your own namespaces: just prefix them with the name
  of your organization.
  <span style="font-style: italic;">Microsoft.VisualBasic</span> is
  an example.
</p>

<h3><a name="Assemblies" id="Assemblies"></a>Assemblies</h3>

<p>
  Assemblies are the physical packaging of the class libraries. These
  are <span style="font-style: italic;">.dll</span> files, but don't
  confuse them with Win32 shared libraries. Examples are<br />
  <ul>
    <li>mscorlib.dll</li>
    <li>System.dll</li>
    <li>System.Data.dll</li>
    <li>Accessibility.dll</li></ul>
  Note that namespaces are often distributed among several
  assemblies. Again, see the
  <a href="http://go-mono.com/class-status.html">Mono class library
    status page</a>. An assembly can also be composed of several
  files.
</p>

<h2><a name="Common_Language_Infrastructure"
       id="Common_Language_Infrastructure"></a>Common Language
  Infrastructure</h2>
<p>More commonly known as the
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Common Language Runtime</span>,
  this is implemented by the Mono executable. This runtime is used to
  execute the compiled .NET application. The common language
  infrastructure is defined by ECMA standard
  <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-335.htm">ECMA-335</a>.<br />
</p>
<p>To run your application, you must invoke the runtime with the
  relevant parameters.</p>

<h2><a name="Common_Language_Specification"
       id="Common_Language_Specification"></a>Common Language
  Specification</h2>
<p>This is specified in ECMA-335,chapter 6. It defines the
  interface to the CLI, such as conventions like the underlying types
  for Enum.</p>
<p>The Mono compiler generates an image that conforms to the CLS.
  This is the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Common Intermediate
    Language</span>. The Mono runtime takes this image and runs it.</p>
<p>The ECMA standard formally defines a library that conforms to
  the CLS as a
  <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">framework</span></span>.</p>


<h2><a name="Managed Code"
       id="Managed_Code"></a>Managed and Unmanaged Code</h2>

<p>
Within a native .NET/Mono application, all code is <i>managed</i>; that is,
it is governed by the CLI's style of memory management and thread safety.
.NET/Mono applications can use legacy code, which is referred to as 
<i>unmanaged</i>, by using the <tt>System.InterOpServices</tt> libraries to 
create C# bindings. Many of the libraries which ship with Mono use this
feature of the CLI; in particular, the Gtk# libraries are C# wrappers
around the underlying C libraries.
