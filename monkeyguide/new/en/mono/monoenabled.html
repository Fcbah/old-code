	<h2><a name="notimplemented" id="notimplemented">Platforms
	supported</a></h2>Mono is available on Windows, Linux, MacOS X, Solaris
	and FreeBSD.
	<br />

	<p>
	  The Mono compilation engine is easy to port to new platforms and
	  provides a solid framework for code optimization. It also includes 
	  a code pre-compiler to reduce startup time. For some platforms, a
	  faster interpreter called Jitter is available as well. See <a
	  href="http://go-mono.com">the Mono web page</a> for the latest
	  platform support listings.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Mono includes two execution systems: one is based on an
	  interpreter (the <tt>mint</tt> command) and another one is
	  based on an advanced code geneerator (the <tt>mono</tt>)
	  command).
	</p>

	<p>
	  The <tt>mono</tt> command can be used in Just-in-Time (JIT) mode
	  by typing <tt>mono</tt> followed by the program to run, or
	  it can be used in batch mode, by passing the <tt>--aot</tt>
	  flag (AOT stands for `Ahead Of Time').  In JIT-mode not all
	  optimizations are turned on, since some of them can be quite time
	  consuming.  For this reason, when
	  using it in batch mode, it is recommended that you use the
	  <tt>-O=all</tt> switch to improve the code generation, for example:
	</p> 

	<pre class="console">

    $ mono --aot -O=all library.dll
	</pre>

	<p>
	  The above will leave the native version of the code in `library.dll.so' 
	</p>

	<h2><a name="notimplemented" id="notimplemented">Toolkit Support</a></h2>

	<p>
	Mono currently has support for GNOME and GTK toolkits through the GTK#
	package, and for Windows native toolkits through the
	System.Windows.Forms APIs.
