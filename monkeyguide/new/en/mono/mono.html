<h1> What is Mono?</h1> 

<p>Mono is a community-built implementation of the .NET
  Framework for a wide
  range of operating systems and CPU architectures. In reality,
  Microsoft's .NET Framework is only the most common implementation
  of an ECMA standard, numbers 334 and 335, which allows for
  programs to be developed on any platform and run on any other
  platform.
</p>

<p>ECMA 334/335's architecture is a win for programmers. 
  It reduces the cost of development and improves maintainability
  by taking care of the low-level boring details. This allows
  programmers to focus on innovation and on having fun.</p>

<p>As of this writing, Mono supports Linux, Unix, 
  Windows, MacOS and other embedded systems as the host OS, 
  and Intel, PPC, Sparc, ARM and HPPA as the host CPUs.</p>

<p>The Mono project's work currently includes the basics:</p>

<blockquote>
	
  <p>C# compiler, a virtual machine, an advanced code
    generation engine (for just-in-time compilation and
    pre-compilation of code).</p>
  
  <p>Class libraries to support ASP.NET WebForms,
    WebServices, ADO.NET databases and Windows.Forms</p>

  <p>Mono, Unix or Gnome specific libraries.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>However, we have not limited ourselves to implementing the
  Microsoft APIs.  Mono ships with various libraries that
  exploit features unique to Unix, Gnome, and other free/open source
  software.</p>

<p>Conceptually:</p>

<p>Mono allows developers to build Unix/Linux applications with
  Gtk+ and Gnome for the desktop; to work with vector graphics using the
  powerful Cairo library; and to build advanced GUIs based on
  the Mozilla libraries. This makes the Mono framework an excellent
  choice for building Linux/Unix applications.</p>

<p>Mono's libraries support third-party databases (Postgres, MySQL, DB2,
  Sybase, SqlLite), standards-compliant directory
  services (LDAP). In addition to XML Schema support, Mono libraries
  provide validators and readers for Relax NG-based systems.</p>

<p>If you're a developer with Windows experience, Mono makes it
  easy for you to build Linux applications. If you have Linux experience,
  Mono makes your code faster to build and easier to port to
  other platforms.</p>
	
<h2>The Importance of a free implementation of the ECMA standards</h2>

<p>Today the .NET/ECMA virtual machine is one of the most
  advanced commercial VMs available, and we want to bring the
  benefits of this virtual machine to Linux developers. We also
  want Linux to compete in the marketplace in terms of
  programmer productivity.</p>

<p>It is also key to allow Windows developers to support more
  than one platform with their codebase, instead of requiring
  them to rewrite their code to support Linux or the Mac: they
  can share the engine of their applications, and port their GUI
  to native libraries: Gtk on Linux, and Cocoa on Mac, while
  keeping all of their code in C# and obtaining the benefits of
  this rich VM and all of the class libraries available for
  them.</p>

<p>In a way, you get to reuse your knowledge, your experience,
  your staff to support more platforms, and you can reduce your
  costs of development.</p>

<h2>State of Mono</h2>

<p>The Mono 1.0 series includes the execution environment, the C#
  compiler, the pre-compiler, JIT engine and associated
  libraries.</p>

<p>The ASP.NET WebForms, ASP.NET Web Services, ADO.NET, Remoting,
  serialization, DirectoryServices are all functional and being
  used on a day-to-day basis.  </p>

<p>The major components that will not ship in the Mono 1.0 time
  frame are Code Access Security (CAS),  Windows.Forms and
  EnterpriseServices (which we are not likely to support at any
  point) nor support for COM components.  </p>

<p>COM is not wildly used in Unix, only a few apps use it, and
  when they do, its their own version of COM (Mozilla and
  OpenOffice), so we have no plans at this point for that.</p>

<h2>Mono and Licensing</h2>

<p>The Mono runtime is licensed under the terms of the GNU
  LGPL, but it is also available under a commercial license for
  those who want to add proprietary extensions to the virtual
  machine. For licensing details, contact mono-licensing@ximian.com.</p>

<p>The Mono Compilers (C#, VB.NET) are licensed under the
  terms of the GNU GPL.</p>

<p>The Mono class libraries are licensed under the terms of
  the MIT X11 license, which is a very lax open source license.</p>
