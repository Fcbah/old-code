<h2>Introduction</h2>
<b>Multithread-Applications</b> are Applications, that have not
only one Application path, but several, that are executed
side-by-side. That way an application can process a task, without
stopping the user from performing other actions with the tool. A
good example would be an app with search functionality, that let's
the user still work, while searching.
