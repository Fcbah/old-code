<h2>Introduction</h2>
System.Windows.Forms (SWF or S.W.F) is Microsofts GUI toolkit
shipped with the .NET Framework. It does definatly not aim to be
cross-platform, but only wants to integrate best with Windows. 
<p>Nevertheless for compatiblity, and to have - just like for Gnome
or KDE - a native toolkit, mono has implemented the API. It does
work perfectly on Windows, just like you would expect it. However
on Unixes or MacOS X, the situation is more difficult. The current
implementation is built on top of wineLIB, and theoritically even
complex things like ActiveX objects will work someday.</p>
<p>But wine is still an emulator, so I do not recommend to code
against that API, if you want to stay cross-platform. There are
enough alternatives out there. I have decided to put it in the
tutorial, because it is a very useful API, when your application
needs to run on windows only.</p>
