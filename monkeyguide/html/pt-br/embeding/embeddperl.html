<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This document describes how to embed the Mono runtime in your
Perl application. You can also get Paolo Molars's
<a href="http://primates.ximian.com/~lupus/slides/embed/Mono-0.01.tar.gz">
sample Mono module for Perl</a>.</p>
<p>Mono can be embedded in every language, that allow C
extensions/plugins, or is written in C. Unlike a CIL Perl compiler,
such Perl code doesn't have all the advantages, that C# or Mbas
code has. It doesn't run with the .NET Runtime and is not
necessarily portable. The application is not executes by mono, but
with the Perl interpreter.</p>
<p>Because of that, this is especially used to use the powerful
class library, Gtk# or other C# classes of mono. For example with
Paolos Perl binding, you don't need Gnome Perl bindings anymore.
Perl can make use of Gtk#. It can also access Databases through
ADO.NET, make use of the XML classes, etc. It can't do ASP.NET for
example, because it's not a cil application.</p>

use blib;
use Mono qw(System::Console System::Environment);

System::Console::WriteLine ("from perl");
System::Console::WriteLine (10);

$user = System::Environment::get_UserName ();

print "the current user is $user\n";

Now let's see how it is done.
