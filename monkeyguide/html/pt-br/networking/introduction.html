<h2>Introduction</h2>
The System.Net namespace contain several classes to work with TCP/IP or HTTP connections. We will start low-level with the TCP-Client. 

<h2>Protocol</h2>

When Data is sent over a network it is in most cases sent over a specific protocol. TCP/IP is the protocl, used almost everywhere. Theere are only some exceptions, like Games, that run with different protocols like UDP.


TCP/IP is a connection-based protocol.


<h2>Sockets</h2>

<p>Because of being connection-based, TCP/IP forces both connection partners to do a "Handshake" before the connction is established.</p>

<p>Also, the data is sent in packets, and it can happen, that packets, that are sent later arrive first at the partner, so they must be reordered.</p>

<p>Luckily the programmer does not have to care about such things (not even Mono itself must care), because networking is handled by the Operation System. The lowest levbel, where you can do networking is through Sockets.</p>


<p>In such applications the both partners have two different types:</p>

<ul>
	<li>One partner is Server</li>
	<li>The other one is Client</li>
</ul>

<p>The Server is listening on a special port and waits for one or more Clients to connect.</p>

<p>The Client can connect to the server and will send some data (request) and the server can answer the request by sending some data back (response).</p>

<p>We will start by doing a simple TCP server.</p>
