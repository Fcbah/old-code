In order to write applications for Gnome with mono, you need to
have Gtk# installed in addition to mono. Besides that you will need
the "Gnome Development Platform" a big set of libaries that form the
foundation of Gtk#. For some features it is useful to have the Gnome
desktop installed. 
<h3>Install Gnome</h3>
<p>You will need at least the Gnome Development Platform, but you
will feel more integrated with the Gnome desktop. Both should be
available for your distribution. If not (or you do not know where to get it, or
your distribution is older), there is a very easy, but good package
to build Gnome from source, GARNOME. I have built Gnome with it at least 2 times,
and it works without problems. You can get it
<a href="http://www.gnome.org/~jdub/garnome/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The easiest option is to install the Ximian 2 Desktop. It is just
a matter of typing one line in a terminal - a GUI setup will get
the packages from the Ximian servers.</p>
<h3>Install Gtk#</h3>
To get started with GNOME.NET you need to install Gtk# which
contains bindings to gtk+2.x and various other bindings for GNOME
specific libraries. Gtk# binaries are not completely platform
independent, as they use a small C glue library. On Debian, it is
recommended to install the Debian packages from
<a href="http://www.atoker.com/mono/">here</a>. You can also get the
source from the homepage
<a href="http://gtk-sharp.sourceforge.net/">gtk-sharp-sf.net</a>. 
<p>On windows you can either download the zip file from the
homepage, or a binary installer, that is designed to work with the
mono installer.</p>
<h3>Install Glade Interface Builder</h3>
This tool is not required, but can help you to easily create glade
xml files for the GUI, using drag-and-drop. <br />
Glade is a free user interface builder for GTK+ and GNOME. It is
released under the GNU General Public License (GPL). 
<p>Glade can produce C source code itself. In C# you can use it
through Glade#, that can read XML files produced by the Interface
Builder.</p>
<h4>Installation</h4>
You can download Glade sources and packages from the
<a href="http://glade.gnome.org">glade homepage</a> <br />
A windows port is available from here:
<a href="http://primates.ximian.com/~damon/glade/WinGlade.exe">Windows
Port</a>
