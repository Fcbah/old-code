Gnome# is a library built on top of Gtk, by the Gnome project. It
turned out, that Gtk+ was lacking high-level widgets that were
added through this library. However, though it gives you powerful
APIs and better integration with the Gnome desktop, using these classes will also
make your application un-portable to Windows or Mac (until someone
steps up to port libgnome).
<p>This tutorial describes how to build applications with Gnome# and
demonstrates some of the most popular classes.</p>
