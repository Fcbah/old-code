Using the CanvasLine you can draw a simple line on th screen - not
much more. As always we must create the Object first. 
<pre class="code">
CanvasLine line1 = new CanvasLine(root);
</pre>
The first argument "root" is the Canvas root as created in the
first example. Now as the CanvasText has been created we can use
it. 
<p>Unfortunately it is not that comfortable to position a line,
than it is to set the position of the text.</p>
<p>The coordinates must be contained in an array of the type
double.</p>
<pre class="code">
double[] points = {0, 10, 0, 100};
</pre>
This would mean the first point has the coordinates (0/10), the
second one has (0/100). 
<p>The points array can not be directly assigned to the Points
property, because it expects a CanvasPoints object.</p>
<p>The first step is to define the coordinates, where the text
should be placed. This can be done easily by using the X / Y
properties.</p>
<pre class="code">
text1.X = int x_coordinate;
text1.Y = int y_coordinate;
</pre>
It is important to know, that those coordinates do not describe the
top-left corner of the text, but the center. 
<p>It is just as important to define a color for your text. If you
don't do this, the text will not display on the screen. For
consistency with other items the Color is called FillColor.</p>
<pre class="code">
text1.FillColor = string color;
</pre>
The color can be either a name like "red", "green", "black" or a
HTML-like color code. 
<p>Often used examples for color-codes are:</p>
<pre class="code">
#000000 - black
#ffffff - white
        - red
</pre>
Last, but not least the most important property is of course the
text itself: 
<pre class="code">
text1.Text = string text;
</pre>
<p>After that the text must be shown using Show().</p>
<p>That's it.</p>
