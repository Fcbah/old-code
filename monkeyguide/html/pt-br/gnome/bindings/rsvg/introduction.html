<p>Rsvg# is a .NET binding to the librsvg library.
(<em>librsvg</em> is sometimes also call <em>rsvg</em>.) Rsvg# lets
you make use of SVG files in your applications.</p>
<p>SVG is vector graphics format which looks similar to HTML. More
specifically, SVG is a W3C vector graphics format and language for
describing two-dimensional graphics in XML.</p>
<p>One of the important things to understand about Rsvg# is that it
is a <em>rendering</em> library for SVG files. (In fact, the
"<em>R</em>" in <em>Rsvg</em> stands for <em>render</em>.) What
this means is that Rsvg does not automatically do any scaling or
resizing for you. If you want to resize or rescale, then you must
re-render. (When SVG files are rendered, they are turned into
Pixmap images, and stores in a <code>Gtk.Pixbuf</code>.)</p>
<p>This section describes how to build applications which use
Rsvg#.</p>
