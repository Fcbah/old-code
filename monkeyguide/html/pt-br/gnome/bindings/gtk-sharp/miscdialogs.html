The Dialog widget is very simple, and is actually just a window
with a few things pre-packed into it for you. The structure for a
Dialog is: 
<pre class="code">
class Dialog
{
      Window window;
    
      Widget vbox1;
      Widget action_area1;
};
</pre>
So you see, it simply creates a window, and then packs a vbox into
the top, which contains a separator and then an hbox called the
"action_area". 
<p>The Dialog widget can be used for pop-up messages to the user,
and other similar tasks. There are two functions to create a new
Dialog.</p>
<pre class="code">
Dialog dialog1 = new Dialog();
Dialog dialog2 = new DialogWithButton( string title,
                                       Window      parent,
                                       DialogFlags  flags, 
                                       string    first_button_text,
                                       ... );
</pre>
The first function will create an empty dialog, and it is now up to
you to use it. You could pack a button in the action_area by doing
something like this: 
<pre class="code">
Button button = new Button("My Button");
window1.ActionArea.PackStart(button, true, true, 0);
button.Show();
</pre>
And you could add to the vbox area by packing, for instance, a
label in it, try something like this: 
<pre class="code">
Label label1 = new Label ("Dialogs are groovy");
window1.VBox.PackStart(label1, true, true 0);
label1.Show();
</pre>
As an example in using the dialog box, you could put two buttons in
the action_area, a Cancel button and an Ok button, and a label in
the vbox area, asking the user a question or giving an error etc.
Then you could attach a different signal to each of the buttons and
perform the operation the user selects. 
<p>If the simple functionality provided by the default vertical and
horizontal boxes in the two areas doesn't give you enough control
for your application, then you can simply pack another layout
widget into the boxes provided. For example, you could pack a table
into the vertical box.</p>
<p>The more complicated DialogWithButtons() variant allows to set
one or more of the following flags.</p>
<pre class="code">
Gtk.Dialog.Modal                // make the dialog modal.
Gtk.Dialog.DestroyWithParent    // ensures that the dialog window is 
                                // destroyed together with the specified parent.
Gtk.Dialog.NoSeparator          // omits the separator between the vbox and the action_area.
</pre>
