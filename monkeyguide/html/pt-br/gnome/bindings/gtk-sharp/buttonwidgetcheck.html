<body>
Check buttons inherit many properties and functions from the the
toggle buttons above, but look a little different. Rather than
being buttons with text inside them, they are small squares with
the text to the right of them. These are often used for toggling
options on and off in applications. 
<p>The creation functions are similar to those of the normal
button.</p>
<pre class="code">
GtkWidget CheckButton1 = new CheckButton();
GtkWidget CheckButton1 = new CheckButtonWithLabel(string label);
GtkWidget CheckButton1 = new CheckButtonWithMnemonic(string label);
</pre>
The CheckButtonWithLabel() function creates a check button with a
label beside it. 
<p>Checking the state of the check button is identical to that of
the toggle button.</p>
