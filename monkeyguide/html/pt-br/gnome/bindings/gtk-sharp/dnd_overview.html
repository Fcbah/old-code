<p>An application capable of GTK+ drag-and-drop first defines and
sets up the GTK+ widget(s) for drag-and-drop. Each widget can be a
source and/or destination for drag-and-drop. Note that these GTK+
widgets must have an associated X Window, check using
GTK_WIDGET_NO_WINDOW(widget)).</p>
<p>Source widgets can send out drag data, thus allowing the user to
drag things off of them, while destination widgets can receive drag
data. Drag-and-drop destinations can limit who they accept drag
data from, e.g. the same application or any application (including
itself).</p>
<p>Sending and receiving drop data makes use of GTK+ signals.
Dropping an item to a destination widget requires both a data
request (for the source widget) and data received signal handler
(for the target widget). Additional signal handers can be connected
if you want to know when a drag begins (at the very instant it
starts), to when a drop is made, and when the entire drag-and-drop
procedure has ended (successfully or not).</p>
<p>Your application will need to provide data for source widgets
when requested, that involves having a drag data request signal
handler. For destination widgets they will need a drop data
received signal handler.</p>
<p>So a typical drag-and-drop cycle would look as follows:</p>
<p>1. Drag begins.</p>
<p>2. Drag data request (when a drop occurs).</p>
<p>3. Drop data received (may be on same or different
application).</p>
<p>4. Drag data delete (if the drag was a move).</p>
<p>5. Drag-and-drop procedure done.</p>
<p>There are a few minor steps that go in between here and there,
but we will get into detail about that later.</p>
