<p>In this section, we will build a simple drawing program. In the
process, we will examine how to handle mouse events, how to draw in
a window, and how to do drawing better by using a backing pixmap.
After creating the simple drawing program, we will extend it by
adding support for XInput devices, such as drawing tablets. GTK
provides support routines which makes getting extended information,
such as pressure and tilt, from such devices quite easy.</p>
