<p>What if you have a function which you want to be called when
nothing else is happening ?</p>
<pre class="code">
gint gtk_idle_add( GtkFunction function,
                   gpointer    data );
</pre>
This causes GTK to call the specified function whenever nothing
else is happening. 
<pre class="code">
void gtk_idle_remove( gint tag );
</pre>
I won't explain the meaning of the arguments as they follow very
much like the ones above. The function pointed to by the first
argument to gtk_idle_add will be called whenever the opportunity
arises. As with the others, returning FALSE will stop the idle
function from being called.
