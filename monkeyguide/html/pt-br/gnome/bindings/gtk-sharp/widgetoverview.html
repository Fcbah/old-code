<p>The general steps to creating a widget in GTK are:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. new Gtk.*() - one of various functions to create a new
widget. These are all detailed in this section.</li>
<li>2. Connect all signals and events we wish to use to the
appropriate handlers.</li>
<li>3. Set the attributes of the widget.</li>
<li>4. Pack the widget into a container using the appropriate call
such as gtk_container_add() or gtk_box_pack_start().</li>
<li>5. *.Show() the widget.</li>
<li>6. gtk_widget_show() lets GTK know that we are done setting the
attributes of the widget, and it is ready to be displayed. You may
also use gtk_widget_hide to make it disappear again. The order in
which you show the widgets is not important, but I suggest showing
the window last so the whole window pops up at once rather than
seeing the individual widgets come up on the screen as they're
formed. The children of a widget (a window is a widget too) will
not be displayed until the window itself is shown using the
gtk_widget_show() function.</li></ul>
