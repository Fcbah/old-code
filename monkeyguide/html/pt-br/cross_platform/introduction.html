<h2>Introduction</h2>

Today applications need often run on a wide range of platforms.
Though cross-platform C-compilers are available, it's still a lot
of work to port, and binaries can't be shared across those
platforms. This is one of the reasons, why Java got so popular.
With the arrival of .NET many people (including me) immediately
liked it. But I always had a bad feeling using it, because I knew I
was bound to one platform - Microsoft Windows.
<p>The arrival of mono solved this issue in a perfect way. Although
many people believe Java is somehow more portable, they're wrong.
All mono including the big, big class library is 100% cross
platform compatible between Windows and Linux. There are some
libraries, that mono depends on, but more and more get replaced by
100% C# code (like for example the MySQL and PostgreSQL data
providers.</p>

<p>Thanks to binary compatibility you can simply copy a binary
compiled on Windows to Linux. Examples are a complete compiler
(MCS) and others. Sometimes application need to p/invoke against
native libraries, but this is also the case with Java, and it will
get fewer and fewer, the more libraries get ported to C#.</p>

<p>That being said you can easily destroy that portability, if you
use certain unportable code parts. This chapters will tell you
anything you kneed to know, and then maybe you just copy your
application developed on Windows to Linux or MacOS X and it will
just work.</p>
