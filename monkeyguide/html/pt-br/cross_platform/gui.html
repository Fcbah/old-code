<h2>Your options</h2>

When it comes to GUI, the .NET Framework shows it's side, that
makes code unportable. Microsoft does offer one toolkit, called
System.windows.Forms. It's based on the Windows APIs, which make it
look native. Mono is implementing it, for compatibility reasons, but
the implementation is based on wine, a windows emulator, and has
several disadvantages. First, such an application can be executed
with mono, but needs a special command, that em,bedds wine. It
integrates bad with the rest of the system on other OS than
Windows and certainly will not be ported to all platforms.
<p>Secondly, and that's even more of a reason, it's not very
powerful. While Windows programmer might be used to it - unlike
both Linux desktops GUI toolkits - it does fix widgets with
coordinates on the form. Gtk#/Qt# use an intelligent boxing-system.
The user can resize the form - it will be never to small.
Internationalization is much easier, that way, because if the text
doesn't fit in the room, the box is automatically made bigger.</p>
<p>The way Java did take is called Swing. Swing looks consistent
(ugly) across all platforms. And it is slow. Very slow. In fact
that's one of the reasons why people think Java is slow in general.
But we have better options. There are two GUI toolkits out there,
one used by KDE desktop, one by Gnome. Both are ported to Windows
and MacOS X. Gtk, the Gnome toolkit, is even ported to Framebuffer
and BeOS. Gtk# (the C# binding to Gtk) is very fast, currently Qt#
is even faster. Much faster than Swing.</p>

<p>So, what GUI to take? My personal favorite is Gtk#. Why? The
Windows and MacOS X versions of Qt are not free, currently. The
developers are working on porting the X11 code to Windows. But
currently it is not done. Besides that I'm a Gnome fan, and more
used to the Gtk+ toolkit.</p>

<h2>II. Learning about things</h2>
<p>The Mono Handbook has a big section GNOME.NET. Not all of Gnome
is multi platform. But we have clearly marked, what is. The portable
part is:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Gtk - Widgets &amp; Co.</li>
	<li>Gdk - Drawin</li>
	<li>Pango - 1st class internationalization support</li>
	<li>Atk - accessibility support for people with disabilities</li>
	<li>Glade - Forms, based on XML, that can be changed
	dynamically</li>
	<li>Glade Interface Builder - Tools to easily create those XML
	files.</li></ul>
	The next step is, to learn about these in
