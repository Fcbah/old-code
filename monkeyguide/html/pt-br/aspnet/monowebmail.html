<h3>Introduction</h3>
Personally I think the best way the learn (programming) is to look
at examples and maybe rebuilding them. For this tutorial I thought
about a sample application and jackson suggested a news site. I
liked it but decided to do something more useful and general, to
be able to show more technologies.
<p>What I'm going to show you now is <b>MonoWebMail</b>, an ASP.NET
based Mail Client &amp; Groupware solution. I'll start simple with
the Mail client and hope to add calendar and such things later. The
application will support themes and other nifty things. ;-) This
tutorial will walk through the code and build it step-by-step.
You'll be able to learn not only about ASP.NET, but also the mono
class library in general.</p>
<p>The code is licensed under the GNU LGPL.</p>
<p>This example shows:</p>
<ul>
<li>ASP.NET WebForms</li>
<li>Monos XML capabilities</li>
<li>Mono database access</li>
<li>Maybe WebServices</li></ul>
<b>DEV-NOTE: The code is in
/monkeyguide/samples/ASP.NET/MonoWebMail/</b>
