Besides typical Web pages, more and more applications are
web-based. The main reason is, because the are easily to maintain,
update, and to consume for the user. Also HTML has evolved and
with CSS, great designs are possible. Those web applications are
mostly either written in Java, ASP, PHP or - now - ASP.NET. Mono
brings ASP.NET to Linux - together with Apache one of the most
important platforms used on the web, today. 
<p>For those "web applications" ASP.NET is better suited than
traditional tools like PHP or Java. While PHP and Java generate a
form for example, by outputting HTML from tags, ASP.NET abstracts a
form from HTML. It's accessible like a GUI form in client
programming. This is a huge advantage.</p>
