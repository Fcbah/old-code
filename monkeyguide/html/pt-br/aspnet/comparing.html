<h2>Introduction</h2>
Could you imagine coding _everything_ in assembler?
<p>Not?</p>
<p>Well, I don't feel comfortable as well. But HTML is easy, so how
should this be comparable? It's comparable in that way, that
current development tools like Java PHP or plain ASP work directly
on top of the technical base, without any abstraction layer.</p>
<p>A calendar does consists of at least 100 lines of HTML with
programming code mixed in. In ASP.NET a calendar looks like
this:</p>
<pre class="code">
&lt;asp: calendar runat="server"/&gt;
</pre>
Cool! But the Browser can't read this. In fact this calendar
consists of 100 lines, too, but they are encapsulated in an ASP.NET
control, and for the developer accessible, like HTML tags.
Developers can of course create their own controls.
<p>Most WebPages for example have those banners at the top, with
logo and sometimes navigation in it. This is a typical case for an
ASP.NET control. So what ASP.NET wants to do, and what makes it
different from other WebDevelopment environments, is, that HTML tags
or complex objects, built of several HTML tags are accessible as
objects.</p>
