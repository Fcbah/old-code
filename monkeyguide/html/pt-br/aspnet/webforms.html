The "Hello World" example is coded in old ASP / PHP style. It is
supported, but results in "spagetti-code". That means the code is
mixed with the design, leading to difficult reading and problems
when the design should be changed. 
<p>ASP.NET offers a new programming model: WebForms. ASP.NET
separates code from design. How is this done? If you have ever
written desktop applications for GTK+, Qt or Windows you'll be used
to widgets like buttons are accessible as objects. ASP.NET finally
gives you this comfort also for WebApplications. Why would you like
to write anymore for the client if not really needed?</p>
<pre class="code">
<span style="color: #0000FF">&lt;%@ Page Language="C#" %&gt;</span>

<span style="color: #0000FF">&lt;% <span style="color: #777777">// This is executed at page startup</span>

public void Page_Load()
{
  label1.InnerHtml = now(); 
}

%&gt;
</span>
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hello Mono!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="label1" runat=server/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
The difference to helloworld! can be seen. The code - the date
"now()" method is removed from the html. Just like with GTK+ a
label is used to put the HTML in. 
<p>WebForms means, ASP.NET has to do quite some stuff to generate
HTML. That's why it'll differ more from the source. Let's take a
look at the generated HTML sent to the Web Browser.</p>
