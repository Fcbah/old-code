Xml (E<b>X</b>tensible <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage) is a Web
Standard formed by the W3C.
<p>It can be used as a data or document file format, for example
HTML is one or an Office file format (all OpenOffice.org files are
Xml). The advantage is, that there are lots of tools and APIs
available to deal with xml and it can be easily edited by hand.</p>
<p>Microsoft has claimed, that Xml would be a central file format
in .NET.<br />
Entsprechend big is the class library offered to work with Xml.</p>
<p>You can:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Read and write Xml documents with the Xml DOM</li>
	<li>Read Xml documents with XPath, a very powerful Query language.</li>
	<li>Use Xslt transformations</li>
	<li>Work with Xml and ADO.NET</li>
</ul>
