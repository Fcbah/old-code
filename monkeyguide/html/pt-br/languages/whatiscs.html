Not as anti-other-languages.
-->

<p>C# is a language designed by Anders Heljsberg of Microsoft. C# was
designed to be an easy to use language. Many elements of the language
are similar to Java and C++. The new language addressed many complaints
about the old languages.</p>

<p>Microsoft submitted C# and the Common Language Infrastructure to
ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association) in 2000. The ECMA
ratified C# as a standard in 2001 as ECMA-334. The ISO (International
Standards Organization) ratified the ECMA standard in 2002.</p>
