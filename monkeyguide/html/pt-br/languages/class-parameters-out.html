<p>
The <b>out</b> parameters are very similar to the <b>ref</b> parameters. In fact, the difference is
that the <b>out</b> parameters don't need to be initialized before they are passed to some method.
For example: if there's a variable called a, that has not been initialized ( no value assigned yet ),
and need to be passed to be modified, the <b>out</b> parameter would be the answer. If the same 
variable is passed as <b>ref</b>, then you will receive a compilation error.
</p>
<p>
The next example would explaint it all: a method that changes the value of a variable not initialized.
<pre class="code">
// 
// out-parameters.cs
// We change the value of the variable 'a'
//

using System;

 class Tester {

	public void ChangeVal ( <b>out</b> int a )
	{

		a = 7;

	}

	public static void Main () {

		Tester t = new Tester();
		int a; // a has no received value assignment
		t.ChangeVal(<b>out</b> a);

		Console.WriteLine(" The value of 'a' is {0}", a);

	}

 }

</pre>
</p>
<p>
The variables/fields passed with the <b>out</b> keyword don't need to be initialized.
But if we try to work with its value inside the method, it won't compile. There's a big difference between
assigning a value, and trying to work with its unassigned value. Remember: a variable without value assigned
can only receive a value, and when the variable has finally value, then it value can be used.
</p>
<p>
Save, compile and run it. You should see:
<pre class="code">
 The value of 'a' is 7
</pre>
</p>
