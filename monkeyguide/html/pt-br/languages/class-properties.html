<p>
If it is neccesary to access a private field in a class, it is possible to do it
using a <b>Property</b>. A property is the representation of some field inside the class.
The signature must have its name, its type, and the reserved keywords
<b>value, get, set</b> and <b>return</b>, and also must be  <b>public</b>. Here is an example:
<pre class="code">
 <b>public</b> int <b>NameofProperty</b> {

	// First part -- We return the value 
	<b>get</b> 
	{
		<b>return</b> this.someIntField;
	}

	// Second part -- We set the value assigned to this property
	<b>set</b>
	{
		this.someIntField = <b>value</b>;
	}
 }
</pre>
In this example, we created a int property for a field, called someIntField. Note that it is possible to
use the first adn second parts for different fields. 
</p>
<p>
Int the first part there is a sentence block after the reserved word <b>get</b>. The get keyword marks the
begin of the output specification. If some extern element want to access the value of the property, it will
<b>get</b> as <b>return</b> the value of some intern field ( in this case, someIntField ).
</p>
<p>
In the second part, there's another block sentence, this time after the <b>set</b> keyword. This word
marks the begin of the input specification. If some extern element wants to assign a certain value to a our
property, it will be able to <b>set</b> the <b>value</b> to a certain field. The value keyword references to the 
value passed when assigning a value to the property.
</p>
<p>
Note that sometimes the second part doesn't appear and the property becomes read-only.
</p>
<p>
The best way of learning if coding. Let's write a small example. There will be a class, PropertyTest, which will
have a private field, called field, of type int. It will also have a property, called Field ( the developers
usually create a property A for an a field, or a Var property for a var field, and so on ).
</p>
<pre class="code">
//
// Using properties
//
using System;

 public class PropertyTest {

	// The private field
	int field;

	// The property
	public int Field {

		get
		{
			return this.field;
		}

		set
		{
			this.field = value;
		}

	}

 }

 public class Tester {

	public static void Main () {

		PropertyTest t = new PropertyTest();
	
		// Won't work
		//t.field = 56;

		// It will work
		t.Field = 108;

		// It won't work
		// Console.WriteLine(" The value of field is {0}", t.field);

		// It will work
		Console.WriteLine(" The value of Field is {0}", t.Field);
		

	}

 }

</pre>
<p>
Save, compile and run it. You should get:
<pre class="console">
 The value of Field is 108
</pre>
Try to decomment the wrong lines, and you should get something like:
<pre class="console">
temp3.cs(35) error CS0122: `PropertyTest.field' is inaccessible due to its protection level
temp3.cs(41) error CS0122: `PropertyTest.field' is inaccessible due to its protection level
</pre>
</p>
