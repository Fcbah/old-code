One of the most important things in the design of the classes are the
constructors. But wait, what a constructor is? Well, first of all, do you remember this
line?
<pre class="code">

 MyClass class = new MyClass();
	
</pre>
Well, here we are using a constructor. So, when you create a new instance and use the
<b>new</b> keyword, you are using a constructor. In simple words, a constructor is a
method used when creating a class instance. 
</p>
<p>
As I said in the last section, the best for learning is coding. So let's write a constructor
por the class MyClass.
<pre class="code">
 class MyClass {

 	public MyClass ( int n )
	{

		this.myField = n;

	}

 }
</pre>
The only difference in declaring a method and a constructor, is that the constructor doesn't need
to specify a return value. Try to specify it like coid or int, and you'll get a compilation error.
If you are asking yourself where is it supposed to be used, here you have the answer: you use it
when declaring a new instance, so, for example, it could be:
<pre class ="code">
 int n = 78;
 MyClass class_a = new MyClass(n);
 MyClass class_b = new MyClass(89);
</pre>
We are passing a integer as parameter, because we specified it in the constructor. Now I'm sure
you'll be able to see clearer the situation: a constructor is a method used when there is need to
initializase some elements in the current instance, and has the special feature that doesn't have a
return value.
</p>
<p>
The last thing you have to remember is the <b>this</b> keyword, which is refering to the
current instance ( remember that every instance has its own elements ). So, when you combine
the <b>this</b> keyword with a dot, you are accessing to the element of the instance. Here, we are 
modifying the private myField field inside the class_b and class_b instances, so, when using the public 
GetResult method, we will be able to guess the return value.
</p>
<h3>Default Constructor</h3>
<p>
When you don't declare any constructor, the environment will use a default constructor for you class.
So, if you don't need to initialize any elements in your class, you'll have no problems when
creating instances. 
</p>
<h3>Private Constructor</h3>
<p>
When you change the <b>public</b> keyword of the constructor with <b>private</b>, you
are specifying yo don't want create any instances of the current class ( who could reach
it? ). 
<pre class="code">
 private MyClass ()
 {

 }
</pre>
As you can see, there's no need of declaring any action, because it is no neccesary.
