As you probably know a computer can only work with binary machine
code, it can't understand a language like C#. However writing
binary is very difficult if not impossible, at least not very fast
;) 
<p>Normally you write the program in a programming language like
C#, that must be translated to machine code. The tool, that does
perform this translation is called "compiler". The result is a
binary file, that can be executed.</p>
<p>Unlike a compiler, who translates a source and creates a binary,
there are also interpreters. They work very differently. Normally
your will feed your source in the interpreter at runtime on the
computer of the user and it will generate native code
on-the-fly.</p>
<p>This has 2 disadvantages...</p>
<ul>
<li>Interpreted code can be read</li>
<li>Interpreted code is slower</li></ul>
... and 2 advantages: 
<ul>
<li>Interpreted code is platform independent</li>
<li>Interpreted code does skip the compiling step</li></ul>
<p>An example for a compiled language would be C or C++, while Perl
is an interpreted language.</p>
