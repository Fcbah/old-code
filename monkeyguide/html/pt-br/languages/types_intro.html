As discussed in the first chapters all data you work with is
represented in classes. This Data can be objects like a color or a
button. But very often you'll work with text and numbers. As any
programming language, you don't have to create those classes
yourself. C# comes with support for those <b>essential data
types</b>. 
<p>This chapter has an introduction to those types and tell you how
to use and convert them.</p>
