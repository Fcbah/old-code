Before we can run our example, we have to compile it to the Common
Intermediate Language, or CIL used by the Mono and .NET runtimes.
Once you have installed Mono, you can type the following at the
command-line: You can pass command-line parameters to the compiler
to change the name of the output file, embed debugging symbols in
the generated file, and more. You can learn more about using the
Mono C# Compiler in section 7.2 of The Mono Handbook. 
<p>The Mono C# compiler is command-line compatible with the
Microsoft .NET Framework C# compiler. If you were entering examples
from a Microsoft .NET tutorial or .NET centric book, generally you
could substitute mcs for any mention of csc, and it should work
OK.</p>
<p>Type this source in your favourite editor (like notepad) and
save it as "hello.cs" somewhere.</p>
<p>Now open a new console window, change to that directory and
type:</p>
<pre class="console">
mcs hello.cs
</pre>
This command produces a file named HelloWorld.exe in the current
directory. This file contains our program, ready to run. <br />
You can execute your first program in C# by typing: 
<pre class="console">
mono hello.exe
</pre>
