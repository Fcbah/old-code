Now it is time to learn how to declare and use a class. In the first steps of
this tutorial, you saw a "Hello World!" sample. You could observe that
you had to declare a class, event you didn't have to use it. This situation is because
C# is a 100% OO language, and it won't let you declare any function or even variable
outside a class. Even the Main() method, the entry point of an application, must be contained
in a class.
</p>

<p>
The best for learning is writing code, so, let's see this first approach to a class declaration.
Note that when you declare a class, you are only defining the prototype of the class, and
if you want to use an instance - create a variable of that type -, you have to declare it. So, let's
declare a useless class:
</p>

<pre class="code">
 class MyClass {

 }
</pre>
<p>
As you can see, there's no difficult in declaring a class. Observe the reserved word <b>class</b>, which lets us
declare a new class type. Next we have the word MyClass, which is the name of the new user defined type. Finally,
pay attention on the brackets; inside them we will be able to put any method/field we could need.
</p>
<p>
Next, if you want to use it, you have to use declare an instance of it:
</p>
<pre class="code">

 MyClass class = new MyClass();

</pre>
<p>
With that line, you are creating an instance. Note the reserved word <b>new</b>; it is neccesary for the
creation of more instances. Did you see the () ? you can make use of them if you want to pass a parameter
when declaring a new instance. Don't worry if you feel you need to know it better; we will be learning this
topic in the next sections, and is called <b>constructor</b>.
</p>
<p>
All right. But this class does nothing, event if we want to create an instance of it. So, let's add it a pair of
elements: a field and a method.
</p>
<pre class="code">

 int myField = 12;

 public int GetResult ( int n )
 {

 	return myField*n;

 }

</pre>
<p>
By the way: if you don't know what a function/method is, don't worry and try to pay attention to this example. 
Continuing with our travel, you will see we have a method that returns a <b>int</b>, the multiplication of a
parameter, n, and our field,  MyField, with value of 12. You will appreciate that the declaraton of our method has a
<b>public</b> word. With it, we are saying "we want to let anyone to access this method" ( we will be studying this
topic in the next sections ).
</p>
<p>
A entire example of this could be:
</p>
<pre class="code">
//
// class-basics.cs
// A first approach to a class
//

using System;

 //
 // Our test class
 //
 class MyClass 
 {

 	int myField = 12;

 	public int GetResult ( int n )
	{

		return myField*12;

	}

 }

 //
 // Our class containing the Main() method
 //
 class Tester 
 {

 	static void Main ()
	{

		MyClass class = new MyClass();
		int n = 56;

		//
		// Call the public accessible method
		//
		Console.WriteLine(" The value of GetResult({0}) is {1}", n, class.GetResult(n));

	}

 }

</pre>
<p>
 Save it as class-basics.cs and compile it:
</p>
<pre class="console">
 mcs class-basics.cs
</pre>
<p>
And run it with
</p>
<pre class="console">
 mono class-basics.exe
</pre>
<p>
If everything went perfect, you should see:
</p>
<pre class="console">
 The value of GetResult(56) is 672
</pre>
