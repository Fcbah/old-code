Sometimes it is neccesary to take some actions if a condition is true, and,
then, take some actions if not. For example: in the last example, the application
prints a welcome message based on a condition. What about take an action for al anternative
behavior?
</p>
<p>
Because of this we use the if/else control struct. It structure is:
<pre class="code">
 if ( condition )
	action to be taken
 <b>else
	action to be taken if the condition was false
 </b>
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Let's write a small application that shows the behavior of a if/else control struct.
</p>
<p>
<pre class="code">
//
// If/else control struct
// ----------------------
// We will simule a user/password system
//
using System;

 class IfElseTest {

	public static void Main ()
	{

		string username, password;

		// Ask for the username and the password
		Console.WriteLine(":: Welcome to Mono System ::");
		
		Console.WriteLine(" Username: ");
		username = Console.ReadLine();

		Console.WriteLine("Password: ");
		password = Console.ReadLIne();

		// If the username is Mono
		// and the password is Handbook
		// simulate a succesful login
		if ( username == "Mono" &#38;&#38; password == "Handbook" )
			Console.WriteLine(" Succesful login. You are in !");
		<b>else 
			Console.WriteLine(" Sorry. Your login or password were wrong");
		</b>

	}

 }

</pre>
Pay attention on the bold words. The reserved keyword <b>else</b> marks the begin of this complementary
struct. So, after the action(s) to be taken, goes the <b>else</b> keyword, and then, the 
action(s) to be taken if the condition was false/unsatisfied. In this case, we print a error message.
Note the <b>&#38;&#38;</b> operator, that reviews if both conditions are true, and if not, the entire
condition becomes false.
</p>
<p>
Save, compile and run it. If everything went perfect, you should be able to probe the
next behaviors on your application:
<pre class="console">
$ mono if-else.exe
:: Welcome to Mono System ::
Username: Carlos
Password: Handbook

Sorry. Your login or password were wrong

$ mono if-else.exe
:: Welcome to Mono System ::
Username: Mono
Password: Carlos

Sorry. Your login or password were wrong

$ mono if-else.exe
:: Welcome to Mono System ::
Username: Mono
Password: Handbook

Succesful login. You are in !

</pre>
</p>
<p>
And yes, you can use the brackets for many actions, in you if section and in your
else section.
