<body>
While in the Perl sample it is clear that the program is executed
line by line and it will at first print "Hello World", this is not
that obvious in C#. You could have a class with several methods: 
<pre class="code">
class Hello {

void Method1() {

}

void Method2() {

}

}
</pre>
What will be executed first? It would be wrong to assume Method1,
because it is above Method2. You could as well write Method2 above
Method1. The truth is the program will not even compile.  There is
always one Method called Main(), that is executed when the
application is started. It is responsible for eventually calling
other methods. 
<pre class="code">
static void Main() {

}
</pre>
Normally methods are always part of an object. The word static does
tell the compiler that this method is not part of an object. That
is because when Main() should be the first executed method we have
no chance to create an object. void indicates, that Main() does
not return anything. 
<p>We do only one thing in our Main() method:</p>
<pre class="code">
Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
</pre>

</body>
