<h2>Basics</h2>
<p><a name="q1" id="q1"></a><b>Question 1:</b> What is Mono
exactly?</p>
<p>The Mono Project is an open development initiative sponsored by
Ximian that is working to develop an open source, Unix version of
the Microsoft .NET development platform. Its objective is to enable
Unix developers to build and deploy cross-platform .NET
Applications. The project will implement various technologies
developed by Microsoft that have now been submitted to the ECMA for
standardization.</p>
<p><a name="q2" id="q2"></a><b>Question 2:</b> What is the
difference between Mono and the .NET Initiative?</p>
<p>The ".NET Initiative" is a somewhat nebulous company-wide effort
by Microsoft, one part of which is a cross-platform development
framework. Mono is an implementation of the development framework,
but not an implementation of anything else related to the .NET
Initiative, such as Passport, software-as-a-service, or corporate
re-branding.</p>
<p><a name="q3" id="q3"></a><b>Question 3:</b> What technologies
are included in Mono?</p>
<p>Mono contains a number of components useful for building new
software:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) virtual machine that
contains a class loader, Just-in-time compiler, and a garbage
collecting runtime.</li>
<li>A class library that can work with any language which works on
the CLR.</li>
<li>A compiler for the C# language. In the future we might work on
other compilers that target the Common Language Runtime.</li>
</ul>
<p>Windows has compilers that target the virtual machine from
<a href=
"http://msdn.microsoft.com/net/thirdparty/default.asp#lang">a
number of languages:</a> Managed C++, Java Script, Eiffel,
Component Pascal, APL, Cobol, Perl, Python, Scheme, Smalltalk,
Standard ML, Haskell, Mercury and Oberon.</p>
<p>The CLR and the Common Type System (CTS) enables applications
and libraries to be written in a collection of different languages
that target the byte code</p>
<p>This means for example that if you define a class to do
algebraic manipulation in C#, that class can be reused from any
other language that supports the CLI. You could create a class in
C#, subclass it in C++ and instantiate it in an Eiffel program.</p>
<p>A single object system, threading system, class libraries, and
garbage collection system can be shared across all these
languages.</p>
<p><a name="q4" id="q4"></a><b>Question 4:</b> Where can I find the
specification for these technologies?</p>
<p>You can find the information here:</p>
<p>C# <a href=
"http://www.ecma.ch/ecma1/STAND/ecma-334.htm">http://www.ecma.ch/ecma1/STAND/ecma-334.htm</a></p>
<p>CLI <a href=
"http://www.ecma.ch/ecma1/STAND/ecma-335.htm">http://www.ecma.ch/ecma1/STAND/ecma-335.htm</a></p>
<p><a name="q5" id="q5"></a><b>Question 5:</b> Will you implement
the .NET Framework SDK class libraries?</p>
<p>Yes, we will be implementing the APIs of the .NET Framework SDK
class libraries.</p>
<p><a name="q6" id="q6"></a><b>Question 6:</b> Will you offer an
ECMA-compliant set of class libraries?</p>
<p>Eventually we will. Our current focus is on inter-operating with
the Microsoft SDK, but we will also offer an ECMA compliant set of
libraries.</p>
<p><a name="q7" id="q7"></a><b>Question 7:</b> What does the name
"Mono" mean?</p>
<p>Mono is the word for `monkey' in Spanish. We like monkeys.</p>
<p><a name="q8" id="q8"></a><b>Question 8:</b> Is Mono usable?</p>
<p>The JIT engine is usable on Intel x86 machines. An interpreter
can be used on other non-Intel x86 machines.</p>
<p>The class libraries are mature enough to run some real
applications (the compiler for instance, and every day more and
more applications are natively developed with Mono).</p>
<p><a name="q9" id="q9"></a><b>Question 9:</b> When will you ship
it?</p>
<p>Different parts of Mono will achieve usability at different
stages, once we are comfortable with the compiler, we will release
"Mono Core", which contains everything needed to develop
applications with the base class libraries, this will happen soon
and in the meantime you can download daily snapshots of our work.
Also the full ASP.NET support is close to completion.</p>
<p>Other higher level class libraries (ASP.NET, ADO.NET, WinForms)
will be released when they become stable.</p>
<p><a name="q10" id="q10"></a><b>Question 10:</b> What major
components will you include in Mono?</p>
<p>Hopefully everything that Microsoft ships on their Framework
(ADO.NET, ASP.NET, WinForms), and we encourage third party
developers to create reusable components that work on both Mono and
Windows.</p>
<p><a name="q11" id="q11"></a><b>Question 11:</b> How can I
contribute?</p>
<p>Check the <a href="contributing.html">contributing</a>
section.</p>
<p><a name="q12" id="q12"></a><b>Question 12:</b> Aren't you just
copying someone else's work?</p>
<p>We are interested in providing the best tools for programmers to
develop applications for Free Operating Systems. We also want to
help provide the interoperability that will allow those systems to
fit in with other standards.</p>
<p>For more background, read the <a href=
"http://www.go-mono.com/rationale.html">Mono Project white
paper</a>. the project.</p>
<p><a name="q13" id="q13"></a><b>Question 13:</b> Miguel said once
that Mono was being implemented in COBOL. Is that true?.</p>
<p>No. It was a joke.</p>
<p><a name="ximian" id="ximian"></a></p>
<h2>The Ximian Role in the Mono Project</h2>
<p><a name="q14" id="q14"></a><b>Question 14:</b> Why is Ximian
working on .NET?</p>
<p>Ximian is interested in providing the best tools for programmers
to develop applications for Free Operating Systems.</p>
<p>For more information, read the project <a href=
"rationale.html">rationale</a> page.</p>
<p><a name="q15" id="q15"></a><b>Question 15:</b> Will Ximian be
able to take on a project of this size?</p>
<p>Of course not. Ximian a supporter of the Mono project, but the
only way to implement something of this size is for the entire free
software community to get involved. Visit the <a href=
"contributing.html">contributing</a> page if you'd like to help
out.</p>
<p><a name="q16" id="q16"></a><b>Question 16:</b> What pieces will
Ximian be working on?</p>
<p>We will devote most of our resources to work on the pieces which
are on the critical path to release a development and execution
environment. Once the project is at a stage where it is useful in
the real world, it will achieve a critical mass of developers to
improve it further.</p>
<p><a name="q17" id="q17"></a><b>Question 17:</b> Will Ximian offer
Mono commercially?</p>
<p>When Mono is ready to be shipped Ximian will offer a commercial
support and services for Mono.</p>
<p><a name="q18" id="q18"></a><b>Question 18:</b> Does Ximian
provide consulting services around Mono?</p>
<p>Yes, Ximian does provide consulting services around Mono to make
it suitable to your needs. Porting the runtime engine, customizing
it, working on specific classes or tuning the code for your
particular needs.</p>
<p><a name="q19" id="q19"></a><b>Question 19:</b> Will you wait
until Mono is finished?</p>
<p>Mono will ship on various stages as they mature. Some people
require only a subset of the technologies, those will ship
first.</p>
<p>More advanced features will take more time to develop. A support
time line will be available in June 2002.</p>
<p><a name="gnome" id="gnome"></a></p>
<h2>Mono and GNOME</h2>
<p><a name="q20" id="q20"></a><b>Question 20:</b> How is Mono
related to GNOME?</p>
<p>In a number of ways. This project was born out of the need of
providing improved tools for the GNOME community, and will use
existing components that have been developed for GNOME when they
are available. For example, we plan to use GTK+ and Libart to
implement Winforms and the Drawing2D API and are considering
GObject support.</p>
<p><a name="q21" id="q21"></a><b>Question 21:</b> Has the GNOME
Foundation or the GNOME team adopted Mono?</p>
<p>Mono is too new to be adopted by those groups. We hope that the
tools that we will provide will be adopted by free software
programmers including the GNOME Foundation members and the GNOME
project generally.</p>
<p><a name="q22" id="q22"></a><b>Question 22:</b> Should GNOME
programmers switch over to Mono now?</p>
<p>It is still far to early for discussions of "switching over." No
pieces of Mono will be ready within the next six months, and a
complete implementation is roughly one year away.</p>
<p>We encourage GNOME developers to continue using the existing
tools, libraries and components. Improvements made to GNOME will
have an impact on Mono, as they would be the "back-end" for various
classes.</p>
<p><a name="q23" id="q23"></a><b>Question 23:</b> Will Mono include
compatibility with Bonobo components? What is the relationship
between Mono and Bonobo?</p>
<p>Yes, we will provide a set of classes for implementing and using
Bonobo components from within Mono. Mono should allow you to write
Bonobo components more easily, just like .NET on Windows allows you
to export .NET components to COM.</p>
<p><a name="q24" id="q24"></a><b>Question 24:</b> Does Mono depend
on GNOME?</p>
<p>No, Mono does not depend on GNOME. We use a few packages
produced by the GNOME team like the `glib' library.</p>
<p><a name="q25" id="q25"></a><b>Question 25:</b> But will I be
able to build GNOME applications?</p>
<p>Yes, we will enable people to write GNOME applications using
Mono.</p>
<p><a name="q26" id="q26"></a><b>Question 26:</b> Do you have C#
bindings for GNOME?.</p>
<p>Yes, we currently bind libgnome, libgnomecanvas, and libgnomeui
-- although I dare say I have no idea how functional the bindings
are outside of what I tested in the sample app. I imagine other
libraries under the GNOME framework will be added on an as-needed
(and as-requested) basis...although a truly good bonobo binding
will have to wait on the CORBA remoting support which has been
started recently.</p>
<p><a name="gui" id="gui"></a></p>
<h2>GUI applications</h2>
<p><a name="q27" id="q27"></a><b>Question 27:</b> Will Mono enable
GUI applications to be authored?</p>
<p>Yes, you will be able to build GUI applications. Indeed, that is
our main focus. We will provide both the Windows.Forms API and the
Gtk# API.</p>
<p><a name="q28" id="q28"></a><b>Question 28:</b> What is the
difference between Gtk# and System.Windows.Forms?</p>
<p>Gtk# is a set of bindings for the Gtk+ toolkit for C# (and other
CIL-enabled languages). System.Windows.Forms is an API defined by
Microsoft to build GUI applications.</p>
<p><a name="q29" id="q29"></a><b>Question 29:</b> Will I be able to
run my smart clients on systems powered by Mono?</p>
<p>As long as your applications are 100% .NET and do not make use
of P/Invoke to call Win32 functions, your smart client applications
will run on Mono platforms.</p>
<p><a name="q30" id="q30"></a><b>Question 30:</b> Where can I learn
more about Gtk#?</p>
<p>The following <a href=
"http://gtk-sharp.sourceforge.net%3Elink%3C/a%3E%20sends%20you%20to%20the%20page%20of%20the%20project.%3Cp%3E%3Cp%3E%3Ca%20name=">
</a><b>Question 31:</b> What can I do with Gtk#?.</p>
<p>Gtk# is becoming very usable and you can create applications and
applets like those you see in a GNOME desktop environment. It's
easy to install so it's worth a try.</p>
<p><a name="q32" id="q32"></a><b>Question 32:</b> How can I compile
my HelloWorld.cs which uses Gtk#?.</p>
<p>Try: mcs --unsafe -o HelloWorld.exe -r glib-sharp -r pango-sharp
-r atk-sharp -r gdk-sharp -r gtk-sharp -r gdk-imaging-sharp
HelloWorld.cs</p>
<p><a name="q33" id="q33"></a><b>Question 33:</b> Is there any way
how to connect DataAdapter to some Gtk# controls?</p>
<p>There is a sample file called `DbClient' in gtk-sharp/samples
that you might to look at. It is a sample program in Gtk# that
adds/updates/deletes information on a Postgress database. When we
have the new table/tree widgets, I am sure someone would write an
adapter for System.Data (in Gtk2 the tree/list widgets are written
using a view/model, so you only need to write a model that maps to
the database). You can have a look at gtk-sharp/sample/DbClient,
where there is a Gtk# application that uses System.Data. It does
not use DataAdapter, but DataReader though.</p>
<p><a name="q34" id="q34"></a><b>Question 34:</b> Do you have an
estimate for when Windows.Forms will be released?</p>
<p>We do not know, volunteers are working on this, but there is no
set date yet. The current approach is using the Wine Library to
implement it.</p>
<p><a name="msft" id="msft"></a></p>
<h2>Mono and Microsoft</h2>
<p><a name="q35" id="q35"></a><b>Question 35:</b> Is Microsoft
helping Ximian with this project?</p>
<p>There is no high level communication between Ximian and
Microsoft at this point, but engineers who work on .NET or the ECMA
groups have been very friendly, and very nice to answer our
questions, or clarify part of the specification for us.</p>
<p>Microsoft is interested in other implementations of .NET and are
willing to help make the ECMA spec more accurate for this
purpose.</p>
<p>Ximian was also invited to participate in the ECMA committee
meetings for C# and the CLI.</p>
<p><a name="q36" id="q36"></a><b>Question 36:</b> Is Microsoft or
Corel paying Ximian to do this?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><a name="q37" id="q37"></a><b>Question 37:</b> Do you fear that
Microsoft will change the spec and render Mono useless?</p>
<p>No. Microsoft proved with the CLI and the C# language that it
was possible to create a powerful foundation for many languages to
inter-operate. We will always have that.</p>
<p>Even if changes happened in the platform which were
undocumented, the existing platform would a value on its own.</p>
<p><a name="q38" id="q38"></a><b>Question 38:</b> Are you writing
Mono from the ECMA specs?</p>
<p>Yes, we are writing them from the ECMA specs and the published
materials in print about .NET.</p>
<p><a name="q39" id="q39"></a><b>Question 39:</b> If my
applications use Mono, will I have to pay a service fee?</p>
<p>No. Mono is not related to Microsoft's initiative of
software-as-a-service.</p>
<p><a name="q40" id="q40"></a><b>Question 40:</b> Is the Mono
Project is related to the Microsoft Hailstorm effort? Is Ximian
endorsing Hailstorm?</p>
<p>No. The Mono Project is focused on providing a compatible set of
tools for the Microsoft .NET development platform. It does not
address, require, or otherwise endorse the MS Passport-based
Hailstorm single sign-on system that is part of Windows XP and
other services.</p>
<p><a name="q41" id="q41"></a><b>Question 41:</b> Will Mono or .NET
applications depend on Microsoft Passport?</p>
<p>No. MS Passport is unrelated to running .NET compatible
applications produced with the Mono tools. The only thing you will
need is a just-in-time compiler (JIT).</p>
<p><a name="q42" id="q42"></a><b>Question 42:</b> What is a 100%
.NET application?</p>
<p>A `100% .NET application' is one that only uses the APIs defined
under the System namespace and does not use PInvoke. These
applications would in theory run unmodified on Windows, Linux,
HP-UX, Solaris, MacOS X and others.</p>
<p><a name="q43" id="q43"></a><b>Question 43:</b> If Microsoft will
release a port of their .NET platform under the `Shared Source'
license, why should I bother with anything else?</p>
<p>The Shared Source implementation will be expensive and its uses
will be tightly restricted, especially for commercial use. We are
working toward an implementation that will grant a number of
important rights to recipients: use for any purpose,
redistribution, modification, and redistribution of
modifications.</p>
<p>This is what we call <a href=
"http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free Software</a></p>
<p><a name="q44" id="q44"></a><b>Question 44:</b> Is Mono a free
implementation of Passport?</p>
<p>No. Mono is just a runtime, a compiler and a set of class
libraries.</p>
<p><a name="q45" id="q45"></a><b>Question 45:</b> Will the
System.Web.Security.PassportIdentity class mean that my software
will depend on Passport? No. Applications may use that API to
contact a Passport site, but are not required to do so.</p>
<p>As long as your application does not use Passport, you will not
need Passport.</p>
<p><a name="q46" id="q46"></a><b>Question 46:</b> Will Mono running
on Linux make Passport available for Linux?</p>
<p>No. However, the Passport toolkit for Linux-based web servers is
available from Microsoft.</p>
<p><a name="q47" id="q47"></a><b>Question 47:</b> Will Mono allow
me to run Microsoft Office on Linux?</p>
<p>No, it will not. Microsoft Office is a Windows application. To
learn more about running Windows applications on Intel Unix systems
refer to <a href="http://www.winehq.com">the Wine Project</a>.</p>
<p><a name="q48" id="q48"></a><b>Question 48:</b> Will I be able to
compile a Microsoft VB.NET application and execute the resultant
MSIL file under MONO on Linux without converting to C# and
recompiling?</p>
<p>Once we have a complete VisualBasic runtime, yes.</p>
<p><a name="q49" id="q49"></a><b>Question 49:</b> Can mono run the
WebMatrix?</p>
<p>No. That requires System.Windows.Forms support which is not
currently implemented.</p>
<p><a name="q50" id="q50"></a><b>Question 50:</b> Does mono have
something like Passport? Will mono have a server side
Passport/Similar framework for XSP as well as client classes?</p>
<p>Not yet, but the client side API for authentication is not the
problem. We will likely have a lot of other authentication APIs,
like the Liberty Alliance APIs. The problem is people on the web
provider end that might use this for authentication.</p>
<p><a name="platforms" id="platforms"></a></p>
<h2>Mono Platforms</h2>
<p><a name="q51" id="q51"></a><b>Question 51:</b> What operating
systems does Mono run on?</p>
<p>Mono is known to run on Linux, Unix and Windows systems.</p>
<p><a name="q52" id="q52"></a><b>Question 52:</b> What
architectures does Mono support?</p>
<p>Mono today ships with a Just-in-Time compiler for x86-based
systems. It is tested regularly on Linux, FreeBSD and Windows (with
the XP/NT core).</p>
<p>There is also an interpreter, which is slower that runs on the
s390, SPARC and PowerPC architectures.</p>
<p><a name="q53" id="q53"></a><b>Question 53:</b> Can Mono run on
Windows 9x, or ME editions?</p>
<p>Mono requires Unicode versions of Win32 APIs to run, and only a
handful of *W functions is supported under Win9x.</p>
<p>There is Microsoft Layer for Unicode that provides
implementation of these APIs on 9x systems.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it uses linker trick for delayed load that is not
supported by ld, so some sort of adapter is necessary. You will
need MSLU and one of the following libs to link Mono to unicows.dll
<a href=
"http://mono.eurosoft.od.ua/files/unimono.zip">http://mono.eurosoft.od.ua/files/unimono.zip</a>
or alternatively search the net for "libunicows".</p>
<p>No changes to Mono source code required, the only thing is to
make sure that linker will resolve imports to adapter library
instead of Win32 libs. This is achieved by inserting -lunimono
before -lkerner32/user32 in the linker's specs file.</p>
<p><a name="pnpproject" id="pnpproject"></a></p>
<h2>Mono and Portable.NET</h2>
<p><a name="q54" id="q54"></a><b>Question 54:</b> What are the
differences between Mono and Portable.NET?</p>
<p>Most of Mono is being written using C#, with only a few parts
written in C (The JIT engine, the runtime, the interfaces to the
garbage collection system).</p>
<p>It is easier to describe what is unique about Mono:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Just-in-Time compiler engine. This is important for making
your applications fast.</li>
<li>A self-hosting C# compiler written in C#, which is clean, easy
to maintain.</li>
<li>Focus on the .NET Framework: we are tracking down the .NET
Framework API definition, as we believe it is the API people will
be most familiar with.</li>
<li>A multi-platform runtime engine: both a JIT engine and an
interpreter exist. The JIT engine runs currently on x86 systems,
while the interpreter works on SPARC, StrongARM, s390 and PowerPC
systems.</li>
<li>Supports Linux, Windows and Solaris at this point.</li>
<li>The JIT engine is written using a portable instruction selector
which not only generates good code (we are told that we are faster
than Rotor, but it is hard to tell) but is also the foundation to
re-target the JIT engine to other systems.
<p>The system employed is described in various compiler books and
it is very similar to what is described in the book that covers
LCC, the ANSI C retargetable C compiler.</p>
</li>
<li>The JIT engine supports in-lining, constant folding and
propagation,</li>
<li>Full support for remoting in the runtime, but the class
libraries are still behind.</li>
<li>The C# compiler, the JIT engine and the class libraries are
mature enough that the whole system is self-hosting. This means
that we develop Mono completely with itself at this point.</li>
<li>We are not yet done, and there is a lot of work left to be
done</li>
<li>We have a great community of developers, without which Mono
would not be possible.</li>
<li>We are working on an ahead of time compilation mode to
pre-compile code for the target architecture (this is part of our
new code generation effort).</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="webservices" id="webservices"></a></p>
<h2>Web Services</h2>
<p><a name="q55" id="q55"></a><b>Question 55:</b> How is Mono
related to Web Services?</p>
<p>Mono is only related to Web Services in that it will implement
the same set of classes that have been authored in the .NET
Framework to simplify and streamline the process of building Web
Services.</p>
<p>But most importantly, Mono is an Open Source implementation of
the .NET Framework.</p>
<p><a name="q56" id="q56"></a><b>Question 56:</b> Can I author Web
Services with Mono?</p>
<p>You will be able to write Web Services on .NET that run on Mono
and vice-versa.</p>
<p><a name="q57" id="q57"></a><b>Question 57:</b> If Mono
implements the SDK classes, will I be able to write and execute
.NET Web Services with it? Yes. When the project is finished, you
will be able to use the same technologies that are available
through the .NET Framework SDK on Windows to write Web
Services.</p>
<p><a name="q58" id="q58"></a><b>Question 58:</b> What about Soup?
Can I use Soup without Mono?</p>
<p>Soup is a library for GNOME applications to create SOAP servers
and SOAP clients, and can be used without Mono. You can browse the
source code for soup using <a href=
"http://cvs.gnome.org/bonsai">GNOME's Bonsai</a>.</p>
<p><a name="q59" id="q59"></a><b>Question 59:</b> Can I use
CORBA?</p>
<p>Yes. The CLI contains enough information about a class that
exposing it to other RPC systems (like CORBA) is really simple, and
does not even require support from an object.</p>
<p>We will be implementing CORBA inter-operation as an extension to
the Mono classes so that we can integrate with Bonobo, just like
Microsoft provides COM inter-operation classes and support
mechanisms.</p>
<p><a name="q60" id="q60"></a><b>Question 60:</b> Can I serialize
my objects to other things other than XML?</p>
<p>Yes, although the serializing tools have not yet been planned,
and you would probably have to implement them yourself.</p>
<p><a name="q61" id="q61"></a><b>Question 61:</b> Will Mono use
ORBit?</p>
<p>No. Mono will be using a new implementation of CORBA that isn't
still started.</p>

<h2>MonoDoc</h2>
<p><a name="q62" id="q62"></a><b>Question 62:</b> What is
MonoDoc?</p>
<p>MonoDoc is a graphical documentation editor and viewer.
Currently, MonoDoc consists of a Gtk# application and is in heavy
development. There is also a Qt# version of it.</p>

<h2>Development Tools and Issues</h2>
<p><a name="q63" id="q63"></a><b>Question 63:</b> Will it be
possible to use the CLI features without using byte codes or the
JIT?</p>
<p>Yes. The CLI engine will be made available as a shared library.
The garbage collection engine, the threading abstraction, the
object system, the dynamic type code system and the JIT will be
available for C developers to integrate with their applications if
they wish to do so.</p>
<p><a name="q64" id="q64"></a><b>Question 64:</b> Will you have new
development tools?</p>
<p>With any luck, Free Software enthusiasts will contribute tools
to improve the developer environment. These tools could be
developed initially using the Microsoft implementation of the CLI
and then executed later with Mono.</p>
<p><a name="q65" id="q65"></a><b>Question 65:</b> What kind of
rules make the Common Intermediate Language useful for JITers?</p>
<p>The main rule is that the stack in the CLI is not a general
purpose stack. You are not allowed to use it for other purposes
than computing values and passing arguments to functions or return
values.</p>
<p>At any given call or return instruction, the types on the stack
have to be the same independently of the flow of execution of your
code.</p>
<p><a name="q66" id="q66"></a><b>Question 66:</b> Is it true that
the CIL is ideal for JITing and not efficient for interpreters?</p>
<p>The CIL is better suited to be JITed than JVM byte codes, but
you can interpret them as trivially as you can interpret JVM byte
codes.</p>
<p><a name="q67" id="q67"></a><b>Question 67:</b> Isn't it a little
bit confusing to have the name of "XSP" (the same as in the Apache
Project) for the ASP.NET support in Mono?.</p>
<p>In Mono, XSP is just the name of the C# code generator for
ASP.NET pages. In the Apache Project, it is a term for the
"eXtensible Server Pages" technology so as they are very different
things, they don't conflict.</p>
<p><a name="q68" id="q68"></a><b>Question 68:</b> What about using
something like Jabber instead of the System.Messaging
namespace?.</p>
<p>In short, MSMQ is not something like Jabber, but asynchronous
messaging through queues. Useful queues do more than serialize
messages, they are also platform bridges.</p>
<p><a name="q69" id="q69"></a><b>Question 69:</b> Are you
supporting XMLDocument and relatives?.</p>
<p>Currently, we aren't implementing them yet. It would require
updates to most of the XmlNode derivatives so it's not a trivial
task. We are currently focusing on getting XPath support
working.</p>
<p><a name="q70" id="q70"></a><b>Question 70:</b> Is there any plan
to develop an aspx server for Mono?.</p>
<p>The web server turned out to be very simple compared to the rest
of the work. Gonzalo has got the page generator mostly done (a
module called xsp, who has nothing to do with the XSP term used in
the Apache Project). Patrik has done a lot of the work to get the
ProcessRequest to work. You can try to help in the final touches to
the System.Web classes and writing regression tests for the widgets
we have.</p>
<p><a name="q71" id="q71"></a><b>Question 71:</b> Is there any way
I can develop the class libraries using Linux yet?</p>
<p>Yes. Some class libraries can be developed on Linux. Search for
Paolo's post (he lists which classes can be compiled fine now).</p>
<p><a name="q72" id="q72"></a><b>Question 72:</b> Is there any way
I can install a known working copy of mono in /usr, and an
experimental copy somewhere else, and have both copies use their
own libraries? (I'm still not very good at library paths in
Linux)</p>
<p>Yes. Just use two installation prefixes.</p>
<p><a name="q73" id="q73"></a><b>Question 73:</b> How should I
write tests or a tests suite?</p>
<p>If you do a test suite for C#, you might want to keep it
independent of the Mono C# compiler, so that other compiler
implementations can later use it.</p>
<p><a name="q74" id="q74"></a><b>Question 74:</b> Would it be too
terrible to have another corlib signed as mscorlib?</p>
<p>We rename corlib to mscorlib also when saving the PE files, in
fact, the runtime can execute program created by mono just
fine.</p>
<p><a name="q75" id="q75"></a><b>Question 75:</b> Is there a
relatively straightforward way to repeat the steps taken by Paolo
to get Mono completely self-hosted on Linux?</p>
<p>To build the compiler and class libraries in Linux, run:</p>
<ul>
<li>make -f makefile.gnu. To install them, run:</li>
<li>make -f makefile.gnu install prefix=/opt/mono</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to produce and distribute a monocharge tarball, run:
make -f makefile.gnu dist Of course you have to run these in the
top level mcs directory.</p>
<p><a name="q76" id="q76"></a><b>Question 76:</b> Is it possible to
build a C# file to some sort of intermediate format which can
linked into a final module, like the traditional .c -&gt; .o -&gt;
.so path? You could do: mcs /target:module file1.cs, mcs
/target:module file2.cs, mcs /target:exe file1.dll file2.dll
/out:mybin.exe</p>
<p><a name="q77" id="q77"></a><b>Question 77:</b> Is there any
plans for implementing remoting in the near future?, When will work
in System.Runtime.Remoting.dll start?</p>
<p>The remoting infrastructure is in place. Some of the channels
and formatters are not.</p>
<p><a name="q78" id="q78"></a><b>Question 78:</b> I'm wondering if
there are any plans to start using NAnt to build the class lib +
test lib. i think that every project need/should use an automated
build process and NAnt + a couple of tools enables this. is the
problem that the compiler can't run NAnt yet?</p>
<p>Maybe well be doing some sort of automated build process +
testing when the summer finish.</p>
<h2><a name="asp" id="asp">Mono and ASP.NET</a></h2>
<p><a name="q79" id="q79"></a><b>Question 79:</b> Is Mono
supporting ASP.NET?</p>
<p>Yes. The development of the support for ASP.NET comes in various
stages, here is what Gonzalo has been working on: 1. The Parser. 2.
Getting the parser to generate output compatible with ASP.NET. 3.
Running the sample output with the real Microsoft runtime but using
our generated page. 4. Running the sample with our classes with the
.NET runtime. 5. Running our sample code with our classes with our
runtime. This is the process we are following. Currently Gonzalo
has reached point 5.</p>
<p><a name="q80" id="q80"></a><b>Question 80:</b> Do I need install
Cygwin to work on ASP.NET in mono or Linux is enough since it is
self host right now.</p>
<p>Linux is enough.</p>
<p><a name="q81" id="q81"></a><b>Question 81:</b> Any plan to make
ASP.NET in mono works with Apache in Linux?.</p>
<p>Yes, we have plans to do so, but we need to wait for Patrik's
patches to HttpRuntime. Once that is there, writing a mod_mono
should be trivial (look at mono/samples/embed for a sample embedded
application).</p>
<h2><a name="ado" id="ado">Mono and ADO.NET</a></h2>
<p><a name="q82" id="q82"></a><b>Question 82:</b> What is the
status of ADO.NET support?. Could I start migrating applications
from MS.NET to Mono?.</p>
<p>You could start right now using the ADO.NET support in mono, of
course, if you want to help filling the missing gaps while you
develop your app :-) Well, what I mean is that we're not that far
to having full ADO.NET support in Mono, and we've got a lot of
working things, so if we could get more help, we'd finish it really
soon :-)</p>
<p><a name="q83" id="q83"></a><b>Question 83:</b> In developing the
data architecture for the application are there and objects I
should stay away from in order to insure the smoothest possible
transition (minimum code rewrite) to Mono's ADO.NET implementation?
(For example, strongly typed datasets versus untyped datasets,
etc...)</p>
<p>We are implementing all the classes in Microsoft .NET's
System.Data, so you can be sure that things will work the same in
Mono as with the Microsoft implementation.</p>
<p><a name="q84" id="q84"></a><b>Question 84:</b> Does Mono can to
connect to Sybase by using Mono.Data.*?</p>
<p>Yes. use Mono.Data.SybaseClient. First of all you have to create
a SybaseConnection, and then, from it, use it as any other
IDbConnection-based class.</p>
<h2><a name="java" id="java">Mono and Java</a></h2>
<p><a name="q85" id="q85"></a><b>Question 85:</b> Why don't you use
Java? After all, there are many languages that target the Java
VM.</p>
<p>You can get very good tools for doing Java development on free
systems right now. <a href="http://www.redhat.com">Red Hat</a> has
contributed a <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org">GCC</a> <a href=
"http://gcc.gnu.org/java">front-end for Java</a> that can take Java
sources or Java byte codes and generate native executables;
<a href="http://www.transvirtual.com">Transvirtual</a> has
implemented <a href="http://www.kaffe.org">Kaffe</a> a JIT engine
for Java; Intel also has a Java VM called <a href=
"http://www.intel.com/research/mrl/orp">ORP</a>.</p>
<p>The JVM is not designed to be a general purpose virtual machine.
The Common Intermediate Language (CIL), on the other hand, is
designed to be a target for a wide variety of programming
languages, and has a set of rules designed to be optimal for
JITers.</p>
<p><a name="q86" id="q86"></a><b>Question 86:</b> Could Java target
the CLI?</p>
<p>Yes, Java could target the CLI. We have details on a <a href=
"ideas.html#guavac">project</a> that someone could take on to make
this happen.</p>
<p>Microsoft has an implementation of the Java language called J#
that can target the CIL execution engine.</p>
<p><a name="q87" id="q87"></a><b>Question 87:</b> Is it possible to
write a JVM byte code to CIL converter?</p>
<p>Yes, it is possible. Here are a few starting point:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">* A byte code representation is
really a flattened forest of trees. Look at the Mono JIT engine to
see how we compute the basic blocks (this is used to figure out the
"trees").
<p>The forest is just an array of trees.</p>
<p>Indeed, run the JIT engine with -d (mono -d prog.exe) and you
will see how these trees look like.</p>
<p>You will have to do something similar for Java.</p>
<p>* Each "forest of trees" has a meaning. This meaning can now be
translated into the equivalent "meaning" in CLR-land.</p>
</div>
<p><a name="q88" id="q88"></a><b>Question 88:</b> Could mono become
a hybrid CIL/java platform?</p>
<p>No. It is quite far from the philosophy of the project. The idea
of Mono is, to have only _one_ VM, on which all can run. And if
there existing a binary-converter from Java-.class to IL and if
there existing something like J-Sharp on Mono, you can write
programs in Java, which than can run on Mono. You do not need two
bindings (like your example: GTK-Sharp _and_ Java-Gnome). You need
only _one_ of it (GTK-Sharp). Thats the idea of Mono. An other
point is, that there are no people, who use Open Source-JVMs. They
all prefer Suns original. But for Unix there don't exist a
.NET-Framework. So it is possible, that in the future Mono is the
standard .NET for Unixes.</p>
<p><a name="q89" id="q89"></a><b>Question 89:</b> Do you plan to
implement a Javascript compiler?</p>
<p>Yes. Eto Demerzal has started a Rhino port to C#. After this is
completed, we will begin developing the JavaScript compiler.</p>
<p><a name="q90" id="q90"></a><b>Question 90:</b> Can Mono or .NET
share system classes (loaded from mscore.dll and other libs) or
will it behave like Sun's Java VM?</p>
<p>What you can do with mono is to load different applications in
their own application domain: this is a feature of the CLR that
allows sandboxing applications inside a single process space. This
is usually exploited to compartmentalize different parts of the same
app, but it can also be effectively used to reduce the startup and
memory overhead. Using different appdomains the runtime
representation of types and methods is shared across
applications.</p>

<h2>Extending Mono</h2>
<p><a name="q91" id="q91"></a><b>Question 91:</b> Would you allow
other classes other than those in the specification?</p>
<p>Yes. The Microsoft class collection is very big, but it is by no
means complete. It would be nice to have a port of `Camel' (the
Mail API used by Evolution inspired by Java Mail) for Mono
applications.</p>
<p>You might also want to look into implementing CORBA for Mono.
Not only because it would be useful, but because it sounds like a
fun thing to do, given the fact that the CLI is such a type rich
system.</p>
<p>For more information on extending Mono, see our <a href=
"ideas.html">ideas</a> page.</p>
<p><a name="q92" id="q92"></a><b>Question 92:</b> Do you plan to
Embrace and Extend .NET?</p>
<p>Embracing a good technology is good. Extending technologies in
incompatible ways is bad for the users, so we do not plan on
extending the technologies.</p>
<p>If you have innovative ideas, and want to create new classes, we
encourage you to make those classes operate correctly well in both
Mono and .NET.</p>
<p><a name="q93" id="q93"></a><b>Question 93:</b> Is there any way
I can develop the class libraries using Linux yet?</p>
<p>Yes. Some class libraries can be developed on Linux. Search for

<p>Yes. Just use two installation prefixes.</p>
<p><a name="portability" id="portability"></a></p>
<h2>Portability</h2>
<p><a name="q95" id="q95"></a><b>Question 95:</b> Will Mono only
work on Linux?</p>
<p>Currently, we are doing our work on Linux-based systems and
Windows. We do not expect many Linux-isms in the code, so it should
be easy to port Mono to other UNIX variants.</p>
<p><a name="q96" id="q96"></a><b>Question 96:</b> What about Mono
on non Linux-based systems?</p>
<p>Our main intention at Ximian is to be able to develop GNOME
applications with Mono, but if you are interested in providing a
port of the Winforms classes to other platforms (frame buffer or
MacOS X for example), we would gladly integrate them, as long they
are under an open source license.</p>
<p><a name="q97" id="q97"></a><b>Question 97:</b> What operating
systems/CPUs do you support</p>
<p>Mono currently runs on Linux, Windows, Solaris and FreeBSD.
There is a JIT engine available for x86 processors that can
generate code and optimizations tailored for a particular CPU.</p>
<p>Interpreters exist for the SPARC, PowerPC and StrongARM
CPUs.</p>
<p><a name="q98" id="q98"></a><b>Question 98:</b> Does Mono run on
Windows?</p>
<p>Yes. You can get pre-compiled binaries from <a href=
"http://www.go-mono.com/download.html">http://www.go-mono.com/download.html</a></p>
<p><a name="q99" id="q99"></a><b>Question 99:</b> Does Mono run on

<p><a name="q100" id="q100"></a><b>Question 100:</b> Will I require
Cygwin to run mono?</p>
<p>No. Cygwin is only required to build Mono.</p>
<p><a name="q101" id="q101"></a><b>Question 101:</b> Will Mono
depend on GNOME?</p>
<p>It will depend only if you are using a particular assembly (for
example, for doing GUI applications). If you are just interested in
Mono for implementing a `Hello World Enterprise P2P Web Service',
you will not need any GNOME components.</p>
<p><a name="q102" id="q102"></a><b>Question 102:</b> Is anyone
working on porting Mono to IA-64?</p>
<p>Nobody is working on such port.</p>
<p><a name="q103" id="q103"></a><b>Question 103:</b> If I were
about to start a Mono port to IA-64,would the same lburg code
generator work for IA-64 also? or anything else need to be used for
code generation(as the processor architecture is totally different
from IA32)</p>
<p>The lburg approach can be use for any processor architecture.
But you might think in another better approach.</p>
<p><a name="q104" id="q104"></a><b>Question 104:</b> Do you plan to
port Rhino to C#?.</p>
<p>Eto Demerzal has started a Rhino port to C#.</p>
<p><a name="q105" id="q105"></a><b>Question 105:</b> Has anyone
succeeded in building a Mac version of the C# environment. If so
can you explain how?</p>
<p>You could try to check with the Darwin people, or the Fink
people. Mono/C# is self hosting on Linux/PPC which is the hard
part, so it should be relatively simple to get it to work on
MacOS</p>
<p><a name="reuse" id="reuse"></a></p>
<h2>Reusing Existing Code</h2>
<p><a name="q106" id="q106"></a><b>Question 106:</b> What projects
will you reuse or build upon?</p>
<p>We want to get Mono in the hands of programmers soon. We are
interested in reusing existing open source software.</p>
<p><a name="q107" id="q107"></a><b>Question 107:</b> What about
Intel's research JIT framework, ORP?</p>
<p>At this time, we are investigating whether we can use elements
of ORP for Mono. ORP is a research JIT engine that has a clearly
defined API that splits the JIT from the GC system and the actual
byte code implementation.</p>
<p>We are using some pieces of ORP (Their code generation
interface) and we use it as a source of inspiration for
optimizations. Paolo and Dietmar consider ORP as being one of the
best JIT engines out there (and their research work and papers are
very useful if you are interested in JIT technology).</p>
<p><a name="q108" id="q108"></a><b>Question 108:</b> What about
using GNU Lightning?</p>
<p>We are not using GNU Lightning. Our JIT is using an instruction
selector based on tree-pattern matching, and a code generation
interface that is very tied to the current architecture.</p>
<p><a name="q109" id="q109"></a><b>Question 109:</b> Will I be able
to use Microsoft SQL Server 2000 or will I need to switch to a
specific Open Source Database. Will I need to recode?</p>
<p>There should not be any need to recode.</p>
<p><a name="q110" id="q110"></a><b>Question 110:</b> What do I need
to watch out for when programming in VB.NET so that I'm sure to be
able to run those apps on Linux?</p>
<p>Not making any PInvoke or DLL calls should and not using
anything in the Microsoft.* namespaces should suffice. Also do not
use any Methods/Classes marked as "This type/method supports the
.NET Framework infrastructure and is not intended to be used
directly from your code." even if you know what these
classes/methods do.</p>
<p><a name="q111" id="q111"></a><b>Question 111:</b> Will built-in
reporting be supported for crystal reports? This is a heavily used
part of our system.</p>
<p>Probably not. Crystal Reports are propriety. Someone may try to
emulate the behavior, but no-one has yet volunteered.</p>
<p><a name="q112" id="q112"></a><b>Question 112:</b> Who about
writing to the registry? As I understand it, Linux does not have a
counterpart to the registry. Should I avoid relying on that
feature?</p>
<p>Try to avoid it. Although there would be a emulation for
registry in Mono too. GNOME does have a registry like mechanism for
configuration. But Even if gnome has a configuration system similar
to the registry, the keys will not be equal, so you will probably
end up having to do some runtime detection, and depending on this
load an assembly that has your platform-specific hacks.</p>
<p><a name="q113" id="q113"></a><b>Question 113:</b>
System.Data.SqlClient with FreeTDS, will you port parts of these to
C# and use them?</p>
<p>if their license is compatible with mono's, yes, we'd think
about porting them. If not, we'll continue with the plan of using
FreeTDS.</p>
<p><a name="gcc" id="gcc"></a></p>
<h2>Mono and GCC</h2>
<p><a name="q114" id="q114"></a><b>Question 114:</b> Are you
working on a GCC front-end to C#? A GCC back-end that will generate
CIL images? What about making a front-end to GCC that takes CIL
images and generates native code?</p>
<p>We are currently seeking volunteers for those projects. Visit
the <a href="contributing.html">contributing</a> section if you are
interested.</p>
<p><a name="q115" id="q115"></a><b>Question 115:</b> But would this
work around the GPL in the GCC compiler and allow people to work on
non-free front-ends?</p>
<p>People can already do this by targeting the JVM byte codes
(there are about 130 compilers for various languages that target
the JVM).</p>
<p><a name="q116" id="q116"></a><b>Question 116:</b> Why are you
writing a JIT engine instead of a front-end to GCC?</p>
<p>We want the JIT engine and runtime engine because they will be
able to execute CIL executables generated on Windows, and so no
recompilation will be necessary.</p>
<p><a name="performance" id="performance"></a></p>
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p><a name="q117" id="q117"></a><b>Question 117:</b> How fast will
Mono be?</p>
<p>We can not predict the future, but a conservative estimate is
that it would be at least `as fast as other JIT engines'.</p>
<p>We would like to ship various JIT engines with Mono, just like
Microsoft has done with their .NET development platform. We could
provide a faster, JIT for fast load times but lower performance,
and an and an optimizing JIT that would be slower at generating
code but produce more optimal output.</p>
<p>The CIL has some advantages over the Java byte code: it is
really an intermediate representation and there are a number of
restrictions on how you can emit CIL code that simplify creating
better JIT engines.</p>
<p>For example, on the CIL, the stack is not really an abstraction
available for the code generator to use at will. Rather, it is a
way of creating a postfix representation of the parsed tree. At any
given call point or return point, the contents of the stack are
expected to contain the same object types independently of how the
instruction was reached.</p>

<h2>Licensing</h2>
<p><a name="q118" id="q118"></a><b>Question 118:</b> Will I be able
to write proprietary applications that run with Mono?</p>
<p>Yes. The licensing scheme is planned to allow proprietary
developers to write applications with Mono.</p>
<p><a name="q119" id="q119"></a><b>Question 119:</b> What license
or licenses are you using for the Mono Project?</p>
<p>The C# Compiler is released under the terms of the <a href=

<p><a name="q120" id="q120"></a><b>Question 120:</b> I would like
to contribute code to Mono under a particular license. What
licenses will you accept?</p>
<p>We will have to evaluate the licenses for compatibility first,
but as a general rule, we will accept the code under the same terms
of the "container" module.</p>
<p><a name="q121" id="q121"></a><b>Question 121:</b> Is the
Mono</p>
<p><a name="patents" id="patents"></a></p>
<h2>Patents</h2>
<p><a name="q122" id="q122"></a><b>Question 122:</b> Could patents
be used to completely disable Mono (either submarine patents filed
now, or changes made by Microsoft specifically to create patent
problems)?</p>
<p>No. First, its basic functional capabilities have pre-existed
too long to be held up by patents. The basic components of Mono are
technologically equivalent to Sun's Java technology, which has been
around for years.</p>
<p>Mono will also implement multi-language and multi-architecture
support, but there are previous technologies such as UCSD p-code
and ANDF that also support multiple languages using a common
intermediate language. The libraries are similar to other
language's libraries, so again, they're too similar to be
patentable in large measure.</p>
<p>However, if Microsoft does patent some technology, then our plan
is to either (1) work around it, (2) chop out patented pieces, (3)
find prior art that would render the patent useless. Not providing
a patented capability would weaken the interoperability, but it
would still provide the free software / open source software
community with good development tools, which is the primary reason
for developing Mono.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous Questions</h2>
<p><a name="q123" id="q123"></a><b>Question 123:</b> You say that
the CLI allows multiple languages to execute on the same
environment. Isn't this the purpose of CORBA?</p>
<p>The key difference between CORBA (and COM) and the CLI is that
the CLI allows "data-level interoperability" because every
language/component uses the same data layout and memory
management.</p>
<p>This means you can operate directly upon the data types that
someone else provides, without having to go via their interfaces.
It also means you don't have to "marshal" (convert) parameters
(data layouts are the same, so you can just pass components
directly) and you don't have to worry about memory management,
because all languages/components share the same garbage collector
and address space. This means much less copying and no need for
reference counting.</p>
<p><a name="q124" id="q124"></a><b>Question 124:</b> Will you
support COM?</p>
<p>The runtime will support XPCOM on Unix systems and COM on
Windows. Most of the code for dynamic trampolines exists
already.</p>
<p><a name="q125" id="q125"></a><b>Question 125:</b> Will Ximian
offer certifications on Mono or related technologies?.</p>
<p>It's possible. But there is no plan about this. So the short
answer is no.</p>
<p><a name="q126" id="q126"></a><b>Question 126:</b> Are there any
Boehm's GC binaries?</p>
<p>Yes. You can find RPMs <a href=
"http://java.thn.htu.se/~toor/">here</a>, though if your
distribution provides the correct packages, you should use those.
The suggested version of the Boehm GC is 6.1.</p>
<p><a name="q127" id="q127"></a><b>Question 127:</b> How can I
report a bug?</p>
<p>The best thing is to track down the bug and provide a simple
test to reproduce the bug. You can then add the bug to the <a href=
"http://bugzilla.ximian.com/enter_bug.cgi">bugtracking
system</a>.</p>
<p>Please provide information about what version of mono you're
using and any relevant details to be able to reproduce the bug.
Note that bugs reported on the mailing-list may be easily
forgotten, so it's better to file them in the <a href=
"http://bugzilla.ximian.com/enter_bug.cgi">bug tracking
system</a>.</p>
<p><a name="q128" id="q128"></a><b>Question 128:</b> Does mcs
support the same command line options as the MS C# compiler?</p>
<p>The Mono C# compiler now supports the same command line
arguments as the Microsoft C# compiler does.</p>
<p><a name="q129" id="q129"></a><b>Question 129:</b> How about
getting searchable archives on lists.ximian.com?</p>
<p>You can perform a search on the mono-related mailing lists
<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/mailing-lists.html">here</a>.</p>
<p><a name="q130" id="q130"></a><b>Question 130:</b> When using
mono from CVS or from a snapshot, I get an error message saying
that Mono and the runtime are out of sync. How do I fix that?</p>
<p>If you use mono from CVS, you need to be prepared for changes in
the runtime internals. This means that you should keep a working
setup before blindling updating (a working setup may just be the
last released tarball or a recent binary snapshot). Usually,
compiling corlib with mcs before recompiling the C runtime does the
right thing (but occasionally you may need to do it the other way
around).</p>
<p><a name="q131" id="q131"></a><b>Question 131:</b> Why are you
going for a GtkHtml implementation?</p>
<p>GtkHTML is just a lightweight HTML rendering engine that does
not support CSS, so we need it to look decent for those of us that
will be using the documentation in our day-to-day work on Linux.
The Web-based interfaces lack the agility that you get from a
native GUI tool to browse your documentation. Probably later on, we
will write scripts and generate a full documentation set that is
web-browsable, but we need a command-line and GUI tools that we can
use natively on Linux when disconnected from the Web (and that has
better interactions than a web page).</p>
<p><a name="q132" id="q132"></a><b>Question 132:</b> Is there a
command-line tool that allows me to access .NET interactively?</p>
<p>There are several but one that is free software and uses MCS is
the one Dennis Lu from Rice University is working on; a REPL C#
interpreter.</p>
<p><a name="q133" id="q133"></a><b>Question 133:</b> Is it possible
to use Visual C++ with Mono?.</p>
<p>Well, It's possible to run VC++ generated apps under Mono
though.</p>
