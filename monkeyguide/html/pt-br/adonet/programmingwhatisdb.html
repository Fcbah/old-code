<p>If you've ever worked with a DB, skip this. You'll only get
bored.</p>
<p>Not many term are as unspecific as <b>Database</b>. As Database
can be a simple address book as well as the Management of a big
Telecommunication Corporation, that needs to handle Millions of
Calls everyday and correctly work with them. The size can be from
few KByte to TByte.</p>
<p>Often the term Database applies to the Data, the resulting
Database files, the Database system or the Database Client.</p>
<p>Technical definition:</p>
<p>A Database is an ordered Collection of Data, that are normally
saved in one or more files. The Data is structured as
<b>Tables</b>, that can be connected to other Tables through
Relations. The applications, that care about the data are called
Database systems.</p>
<p>A Database system does not only manage the data, but also offers
a set of commands, through that a client can receive of insert new
data. Often the Data should be used by several Clients over a
Network.</p>
<pre>
+--------+                                         +--------+
|        |     --   REQUEST DATA / ADD DATA  --&gt;   |   DB   |
| Client |                                         | System |
|        |    &lt;--       GIVE DATA            --    |(Server)|
+--------+                                         +--------+
</pre>
<p>The questions are:</p>
<h3>How is the data stored on the Server?</h3>
All Data in the database is stored in a Table.<br />
This example Table is simple mail Database. 
<pre>
<b>+--------------------------------------------+
| firstname | lastname  | address            |
+--------------------------------------------+</b>
| Johannes  | Roith     | johannes@jroith.de |
+--------------------------------------------+
| Gonzalo   | Unknown   |gonzalo@gnome-db.org|
+--------------------------------------------+
| Miguel    | de Icaza  | miguel@ximian.com  |
+--------------------------------------------+
| Mike      | Kestner   | mike@ximian.com    |
+--------------------------------------------+
</pre>
That's enough for a simple explanation. 
<h3>How is the Data requested/extended?</h3>
The Client (i.e. your application will communicate with the server
typically in <b>SQL</b> (Structured Query Language). This language
has a certain amount of commands to insert, edit and receive data.
In fact it is as powerful, that you can tell your RDBMS to only
give you parts of the data, for example all names, that start with
Mi, could be searched for. This would return Miguel and Mike. I'll
describe SQL in great detail in the next chapter. 
<pre class="code">
// This would insert a new person
INSERT INTO emaillist (firstname, lastname, address) VALUES ("Tim", "Coleman", "tim@tim.com)

// This is the command to receive all names starting with Mi.
SELECT (firstname, lastname) FROM emaillist WHERE firstname LIKE Mi*
</pre>
Which leads us to the last question... 
<h3>How is the data returned?</h3>
Now, what will we get back about Miguel &amp; Mike and how can we
use it? 
<p>Are you surprised to hear it's a ... Table?</p>
<pre>
<b>+-----------------------+
| firstname | lastname  |
+-----------------------+</b>
| Miguel    | de Icaza  |
+-----------------------+
| Mike      | Kestner   |
+-----------------------+
</pre>
Why are only the first two columns included?<br />
After the word SELECT, we specified, what columns should be
returned (firstname, lastname).
<p>You can now walk through the table row-by-row with special
classes provided by ADO.NET.</p>
<p>(For example all selected people)</p>
