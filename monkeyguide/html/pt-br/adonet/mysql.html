My personal choice in the Database Server is MySQL. It's a free,
GPL licensed DB, that is far deploye and currently, the most widly
used Opensource DB. Since 4.0 there are many issues solved.
<p>There is also the other big open source alternative PostgreSQL.
It's OK, too, but it's beneficial if we work with the same DBMS for
this tutorial. So please use MYSQL.</p>
