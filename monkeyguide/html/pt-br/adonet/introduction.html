The .NET framework ships with a namespace, System.Data, that is not
part of the ECMA class library. Mono has implemented it however.
This namespace is also often called with it's marketing term
"ADO.NET". The name comes from ADO, the ActiveX Data Objects,
Microsoft's latest Database layer. ADO.NET builds on top of it,
partially. The mono implementation does not. 

<p>ADO.NET is an API to access Data sources of any kind, but
especially relational Databases.</p>

<p>Microsoft ships the .NET Framework with Database providers for
MS SQL Server, Oracle, ODBC, Ole-DB and XML.<br />
Mono does ship all of these, but additionally native providers for
MySQL, PostgreSQL, and IBM DB2.</p>

<p>Those Databases not available directly can be accessed through
either ODBC or OLE-DB. Both are implemented on Windows and Unix
systems. All those databases share a common interface, that makes
them easy to use, and speeds up porting. There is also a XML
provider, that enables you to access XML files as a database.</p>

<p>This chapter will look at the databases available, differences
in the providers, how to install &amp; program with it and will
give you some examples.</p>
