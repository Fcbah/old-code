<h2>Getting MySQL</h2>
MySQL is offered as a zip file, containing an executeable
setup.exe. If you go with the default settings, MySQL, the
documentation and other tools are installed to <i>c:\mysql\</i>.
The installation will take 20 MB.
<h2>Installation</h2>
On Windows NT/2000/XP MySql will be installed as a service by
default. It will start, when you reboot, but you can also run it
manually with 
<pre class="console">
net start mysql
</pre>
You can stop it with 
<pre class="console">
net stop mysql
</pre>
<h2>Windows 95/98/ME</h2>
Note, that you should never use Windows 9x as server or MySQL on
Windows 9x as production environment.
<p>If you want to work with 9x for development, that's OK.</p>
<p>MySQL ships with a small tool, WinMySQLAdmin, that can help you
to start the MySQL server manually on Windows NT/2000/XP and
Windows 95/98/ME. You can run it with:</p>
<pre class="console">
c:\mysql\bin\winmysqladmin.exe
</pre>

After getting username and password, the tool will resist as a
tray icon. It will put itself in the Autorun directory and startup
the server, when you start your computer, if you click on "my.ini
Setup/Create Button in Start Menu".
