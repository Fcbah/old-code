<h2>Simple Queries</h2>
The most simple SELECT query is: 
<pre class="code">
SELECT * FROM table
</pre>
It will return all records, the complete table. You could
theoretically write code to select the correct data from such a
request on the client side, but this enlarges the code to be
written and is slow, too. Normally you want to select only some of
the columns and some of the records, using conditions. Also SELECT
can give back other things than table data.
<h3>Counting records</h3>
Self-explaining. 
<pre class="code">
SELECT COUNT * FROM table
</pre>
<h3>SELECTING only some columns</h3>
Very often you don't kneed to know all columns of a certain table.
It is more efficient to only retrieve those. Just replace * with
the columns, that you want to get. (Eventually in brackets) 
<pre class="code">
SELECT (firstname, lastname) FROM table
</pre>
</body>
