<h3>Comparing</h3>
Everyone has his own needs, but at least one IDE should fit your
needs. I've put together the pros and cons of all of them.
<h4>Emacs</h4>
+ very powerful<br />
+ multiplatform<br />
<br />
- difficult for newcomer<br />
<h4>Eclipse</h4>
+ powerful<br />
+ multiplatform<br />
+ easy to use<br />
+ widely proven<br />
<br />
- needs big and proprietary SUN Java JDK<br />
- very slow on a PII 350 and maybe even on new machines<br />
<h4>SharpDevelop</h4>
+ powerful<br />
+ easy to use<br />
+ perfectly suited for C#<br />
+ Many designers and assistants.<br />
<br />
- only runs on windows.
