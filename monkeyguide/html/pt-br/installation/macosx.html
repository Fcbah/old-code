<h2><a id="step1">What you need to start</a></h2>
<p class="sidebar"><a href="http://connect.apple.com/"
title="ADC">Apple Development</a> (Free registration
required).<br />
 <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/" title="Fink">Fink</a> at
Sourceforge.</p>
<p>First of all you'll need to make sure you've got the Apple
development tools installed. If you have got them on CD install
them, if not you'll have to go to the
<a href="http://connect.apple.com/" title="ADC">Apple web site</a>
and get them from there. A free registration is required.</p>
<p>Next you need to get a couple of other things:</p>
<ul>
<li>pkg-config</li>
<li>glib2</li></ul>
<p>The easiest way to get these is by using
<a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/">Fink</a> which makes it very
easy. Get the latest version of fink, and run it.</p>
<pre>
sudo dselect
</pre>
<p>Find the packages (pkg-config is installed as part of fink) and
let fink do it's job.</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="step2">Mono</a></h2>
<p class="sidebar"><a href="http://www.go-mono.com/"
title="Mono">Mono</a> website: downloads, help, and info.</p>
<p>Get the 0.18 release of Mono from the
<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/download.html">Mono web site</a>.
You need the mono-0.18.tar.gz source. Unpack the files into a
directory of your choice, *nix people might like to choose
/usr/local/src, Mac people might like Documents/mono, it doesn't
make any difference.</p>
<p>A few things to note first... mono doesn't actually work on OS X
(yet), but mint does (a little anyway). So you should be able to
compile most C# programs that compile with mono, but don't expect
everything to work.</p></div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="step3">Patch for OS X</a></h2>
<p class="sidebar"><a href="mono-0.18-osx.diff.patch"
title="The Patch">Download</a> the patch, and get the os x
<a href="tramp-macosx.c">tramp.c</a> file.</p>
<p>There are few changes required to get mono to work on OS X. Easy
way to do this is to download the
<a href="mono-0.18-osx.diff.patch">patch file</a> from here and
apply it.</p>
<pre>
patch -p1 &lt; mono-0.18-osx.diff.patch
</pre>
<p>Second, you need a different <a href="tramp-macosx.c">tramp.c
file</a>. After you've applied the patch replace the
mono-0.18/mono/arch/ppc/tramp.c file with the new one. (Big thanks
to John Duncan for this file)</p>
<pre>
cp tramp-macosx.c mono-0.18/mono/arch/ppc/tramp.c
</pre></div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="step4">Compile Mono</a></h2>
<p>Now it starts to get easy.... From the mono directory just
type:</p>
<pre>
./configure --prefix=/usr/local
</pre>
<p>If you want mono installed somewhere other than /usr/local, put
something else after the --prefix. Next type:</p>
<pre>
make
</pre></div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="step5">Install Mono</a></h2>
<p class="sidebar"><a href="mcs">MCS</a> compiler wrapper.</p>
<p>Another easy bit (providing all the above went ok...)</p>
<pre>
sudo make install
</pre>
<p>To get mcs (the Mono C# Compiler) to work, you will need to
change the mcs file that gets created in /usr/local/bin. It tries
to use mono which doesn't compile so either change the mcs file to
look as shown below:</p>
<pre>
#!/bin/sh
/usr/local/bin/mint /usr/local/bin/mcs.exe "$@"
</pre>
<p>Or you can <a href="mcs">download it from here</a>. Make sure
the file has execute permissions.</p>
<pre>
chmod a+x mcs
</pre></div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="step6">Test Your Installation</a></h2>
<p class="sidebar"><a href="helloworld.cs">Hello World</a> C#
program for a quick test of the mcs compiler and mint interpreter.
You can also get the <a href="helloworld.exe">compiled version</a>
if you want.</p>
<p>As a simple test to make sure what you have now works, you can
download the <a href="helloworld.cs">Hello World</a> program and
compile it with the command</p>
<pre>
mcs helloworld.cs
</pre>
<p>You will see a warning saying that non-atomic functions are
used, but don't worry about that. Just type the next line to run
your program:</p>
<pre>
mint helloworld.exe
</pre>
