<h2 class="sect2"><a name="obtaining" id="obtaining">Obtaining
Mono</a></h2>
<p>In order to obtain the required software you just need to visit
the Mono download page at http://www.go-mono.org/download or any of
the related sites.</p>
<p>&#13;You'll be able to complete everything in this document if
you just install the runtime, but taking a look at the compiler
package is well worth the effort. The compiler is written in C# and
is 'self hosting' which means it is able to compile itself.</p>
<p>&#13;This page also lists the current versions of the software
mono depends on. Make sure that your system has all the required
versions, otherwise mono won't compile.</p>
<div class="sect2">
<h2 class="sect2"><a name="easyinstall" id="easyinstall">Installing
Mono on Windows, the easy way</a></h2>
<p>&#13; Oh. This is a very easy task now. If you just want to take
a look at the possibilities of Mono get the Mono installer from the
site of Johannes Roith &lt;johannes@jroith.de&gt;:</p>
<p>&#13; http://mono.jroith.de. You can get a link in</p>
<p>&#13; the download section of the Mono site too:
http://www.go-mono.org/download</p>
<p>&#13; Then you just need a Windows machine. Better use Windows
2000 Professional, NT4 or XP.</p>
<p>&#13; Once you've got it, run the installer.</p>
<img src="wsetup.png" border="0" /> 
<p>&#13; Remember, building your own Mono runtime and compiler from
the sources is strongly recommended. You won't discover the power
of Mono until you get it made this way. If you feel hungry about
real programming with Mono, proceed like in the next
section.</p></div>
<div class="sect2">
<h2 class="sect2"><a name="hardinstall" id="hardinstall">Building
Mono under Windows</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&#13; 1.- Get Windows 2000 Professional or any Windows System
supporting .NET SDK.</p></li>
<li>
<p>&#13; 2.- Get the latest Cygwin distribution, be sure you
install the GNU Build Tools packages. Take the openssh package if
you plan to contribute to the project. If you feel insecure about
the packages you need to install, install all of them, of course,
Text, Admin, Games and Web are not necessary at all and you can
pass of those. The fitness of your choice will depend of your
knowledge on Linux and/or Cygwin. If in doubt install all.</p></li>
<li>
<p>&#13; 3.- Install the .NET SDK.</p></li>
<li>
<p>&#13; 4.- Install Cygwin.</p></li>
<li>
<p>&#13; 5.- Get http://www.go-mono.org/mono-build-w32.sh and put
it into your home directory in the cygwin setup.</p></li>
<li>
<p>&#13; 6.- Enter your cygwin environment. If you have an account
in the mono cvs, then export the variables as shown in
http://www.go-mono.org/ccvs.html</p>
<pre class="code">
&#13;             This means. Enter: export CVSROOT=user@mono-cvs.ximian.com:/cvs/public

             and export CVS_RSH=ssh
</pre>
<p>&#13; If you have no account DO NOTHING.</p></li>
<li>
<p>&#13; 7.- Enter:</p>
<pre class="code">
&#13;  export ACLOCAL_FLAGS="-I /usr/local/share/aclocal" 
        and this: export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/bin"
</pre>
<br />
<br /></li>
<li>
<p>&#13; 8.- Run the script (mono-build-w32.sh)</p></li>
<li>
<p>&#13; 9.- All should work fine know and you should see it
download what necessary and build mono.</p></li></ul></div>
<div class="sect2">
<h2 class="sect2"><a name="errors"
id="errors">Troubleshooting</a></h2>
<p>If you have noticed problems during step 8 and the execution
stops because of errors as I cannot find that or such library or
alike, try to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&#13; 1.- Create a directory mono-temp for example.</p></li>
<li>
<p>&#13; 2.- Move and unzip all the zips the mono-build script
downloads to /usr/local to that new directory. Do it one by one,
copying the content of the created subdirectories (include, bin,
etc) to their respectives in /usr/local. Take care, some libraries
like libglib... must go into /usr/local/bin and not into
/usr/local/lib.</p></li>
<li>
<p>&#13; 3.- Jump into the /usr/local/mono directory and run
./autogen.sh</p></li>
<li>
<p>&#13; 4.- Then run ./configure and after it: make and finally:
make install.</p></li></ul></div>
