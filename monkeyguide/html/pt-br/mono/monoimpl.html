Besides the core .NET features, there are many under the hood, in
the class library. This chapter will take a look at what work the
mono project has done, and with what technologies you can work.
<h2><a name="implemented" id="implemented">Technologies
implemented</a></h2>
<table cellpadding="10">
<tr>
<td valign="top">
<h3>C# language</h3>
<p>Mono includes an implementation of the C# language, a language
originally developed by Microsoft and that has now been standarized
by the ECMA and ISO groups.</p>
<p>The C# language takes various elements from the Java, C++ and
Smalltalk systems.</p>
</td>
<td valign="top">
<pre class="code">
using System;

class HelloWorld {
    public static void Main() {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<table cellpadding="10">
<tr>
<td valign="top">
<h3>VB language</h3>
The Basic language hasn't really changed over the years.
VisualBasic.NET however fixes many issues, Basic is now as
powerful, as C# or other languages. Mono ships with a CIL compiler,
making the language just as worthy as C#. Thanks to
language-independence classes written in MonoBasic can be used in
C# as well. The lack of a good supported Basic implementation on
Unix has finally be fixed.</td>
<td valign="top">
<pre class="code">
Imports System

Module Test
        Sub Main()
                Console.WriteLine ("Hello World!")
        End Sub
End Module
</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<table cellpadding="10">
<tr>
<td valign="top">
<h3>LOGO language</h3>
Mono brings the LOGO language to the Gnome desktop (but also to
Windows, MacOS, KDE). Like all mono languages it can make use of
the class library, thus supporting Database and XML
applications.</td>
<td valign="top">
<pre class="code">
Print "|Hello world!|

</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>ADO.NET</h3>
Mono provides a common interface to Databases, so chnaging will be
very easy. The mono hackers put much work into this. You will
hardly find a database not supported, either directly, or through
ODBC or libgda. Very portable, works on all platforms.
<h3>ASP.NET</h3>
ASP.NET is the best Framework I've seen so far, for developing
WebSites and -Services. It's language independent, too. Imagine a
webpage written in pascal, LOGO, basic, C#, C++, ... . You can
access all the class library features and it's very fast, because
all libraries are compiled. ASP.NET also features WebForms, that
make HTML elements accessible as objects and removes the lack of
state in HTTP.
<table cellpadding="10">
<tr>
<td valign="top">
<h3>Gtk#</h3>
With Ximian comming from a Gnome background, Mono has first class
Gnome bindings. GTK+, but also Glade, gnome-db and GStreamer are
supported. Those libraries are ported to most (if not all) Unixes,
MacOS X and Windows and nicely integrate with the Gnome desktop.
There is also on-going work to use native widgets on windows and
MacOS X. Cross-platform is possible!</td>

<tr>
<td valign="top">
<h3>QT#</h3>
QT# has been started by the KDE community and provides a binding to
the KDE developer libraries. The underlying libraries are available
on Windows and MacOS X as well, but are only free on Unix.</td>
<td valign="top"><img src="/html/en/images/empty.png" /></td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>XML</h3>
Mono has perfect support for Xml, with many parsers and processing
libraries.
<h3>Tools</h3>
Mono offers a C and .NET debugger, with the ability to use console
or GUI frontends, IL assembler and disassemblers. There are also
several productivity applications, like a build tool and Unit
testing from third--party projects.
<p>Also there is to mention the mono documentation browser.</p>
<h2><a name="notimplemented" id="notimplemented">2. Classes
implemented</a></h2>
<h2><a name="notimplemented" id="notimplemented">3. Classes not
implemented</a></h2>
While mono tries to implement all classes, those are either not
started or have not progressed enough.
<ul>
<li>Microsoft.Win32</li>
<li>System.Windows.Forms</li>
<li>System.Messaging</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="additional" id="additional">4. Mono's additional
classes</a></h2>
While with about 3000 classes the .NET Framework is quite feature
rich, there are serveral bits that are missing.
<ul>
<li>Platform independend GUI</li>
<li>More Databases</li>
<li>Mailer API</li>
<li>Many others</li>
</ul>
Mono tries to solve this, by introducing a new namespace, and
offering the multiplatform GUI GTK+. Compatiblity is kept, all
classes are known to run with the MS implementation.
<h3>I. Extended .NET: The Mono.* namespace</h3>
<h3>II. Extended .NET: Multiplatform GUI through Gtk#</h3>
<h3>II. Differences on Unix/Windows/MacOS X</h3>
The mono classes don't need to be ported. However if the underlying
library isn't available for a certain platform, some classes might
not work there.
<ul>
<li><b>System.Xml.Xsl</b> depends on libxml2 (very portable)</li>
<li><b>System.Data.Odbc</b> depends on unixodbc or odbc32 (not very
portable, but available for windows, unix)</li>
<li><b>Mono.Data.Sqlite</b> depends on sqlite (extremly small and
portable)</li>
<li><b>Mono.Data.MySQL</b> depends on libmysql (available for unix,
windows; maybe 100% C# implementation in the future)</li>
<li><b>Mono.Data.PostgreSQL</b> depends on libpostgres (available
for unix, windows; maybe 100% C# implementation in the future)</li>
</ul>
