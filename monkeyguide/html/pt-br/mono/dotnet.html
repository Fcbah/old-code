<h1>What is .NET?</h1>
<p>.NET is a product family, shipped by Microsoft in 2001, as a
response to the successful Java from Sun. It's not a clone, but a
complete redesign, with some exciting new features, like language
independence, great Database support, broad XML support, well
designed WebServices and WebApplications support and a big upgrade
to the VisualBasic language, including object orientation. To this
family they also count Services and the Microsoft Servers.</p>
<p>Microsoft .NET is in fact 3 things. It is important not to confuse
them.</p>
<ul>
<li>The .NET Framework</li>
<li>Services (MyServices, Passport)</li>
<li>Other things with the label ".NET"</li></ul>
Mono is just an implementation of the .NET Framework. The .NET
Framework is a "software platform", similiar to Java. The technical
aspect will be discussed in "Architecture". 
<p><b>Language independence</b>. Perhaps the most important factor
is, that all languages "are created eval". Yes, that's the right
word. There are not one or two languages, that can be consumed by
others, if you want to be independent from language. (A bit wired.)
Example: All Gnome APIs are written in C. This ensures, that you
can write an applicaton in Python, by accessing these C libraries
through bindings. But you cannot access Python programs through C.
In the .NET world this is possible. Write in C#, MonoBasic, or
whatever, you can without any problems reuse those classes.
Great!</p>
<p><b>Platform independence.</b> .NET code is not compiled to
machine code, but has an intermediate form. You can copy binaries
across platforms just like in Java. Only native code invokation can
stop this, but it will disappear, when in time.</p>
<p><b>Class library.</b> .NET has a big, big class library, for
almost any task. Especially the high-level classes are interesting.
XML-Support, Database-Support, WebServices-Support and Webpages
support are a few examples.</p>
<p><b>C# language.</b> C# is a very beatiful, clean, effective
language.</p>
<p><b>VB.NET language.</b> Microsoft has finally fixed the
Basic language here. It is now just as feature-full as C# or any
other .NET langauge is and Basic classes can be reused in C# like
C# classes in Basic.</p>
<p><b>web applications.</b>With ASP.NET Microsoft ships the next
generation web page framework. It benefits from language
independence, so finally you can write your we pages with pascal or
C++ as well as LOGO and so on. Also it's the first framework to
break with 100% HTML code programming and makes HTML accessible as
objects, while also introducing complex things like claendars.</p>
