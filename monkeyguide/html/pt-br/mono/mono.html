  <p>Mono is an open source implementation of the Microsoft .NET
  Framework.</p>

  <p>Mono includes: a compiler for the C# language, an ECMA-compatible
  runtime engine for the Common Language Infrastructure (also referred
  as the CLR) and class libraries: both Microsoft.NET compatible as
  well as many more.  The runtime can be embedded into your
  application.</p>

  <p>Mono has implementations of both ADO.NET, 
  and ASP.NET> as part of its distribution.</p>

<h2>Mono project background</h2>

	<p>The GNOME project goal was to bring missing technologies to
	Unix and make it competitive in the current market place for
	desktop applications.  We also realized early on that language
	independence was important, and that is why GNOME APIs were
	coded using a standard that allowed the APIs to be easily
	wrapped for other languages.  Our APIs are available to most
	programming languages on Unix (Perl, Python, Scheme, C++,
	Objective-C, Ada). </p>

	<p>Later on we decided to use better methods for encapsulating
	our APIs, and we started to use CORBA to define interfaces to
	components. We complemented it with policy and a set of
	standard GNOME interfaces for easily creating reusable,
	language independent components, controls and compound
	documents.  This technology is known as <a
	href="http://developer.ximian.com/articles/whitepapers/bonobo">Bonobo</a>.
	Interfaces to Bonobo exist for C, Perl, Python, and
	Java.</p>

	<p>CORBA is good when you define coarse interfaces, and most
	Bonobo interfaces are coarse.  The only problem is that
	Bonobo/CORBA interfaces are not good for small interfaces.
	For example, an XML parsing Bonobo/CORBA component would be
	inefficient compared to a C API.</p>

<h3> The Common Language Infrastructure platform. </h3>

	<p>Microsoft has created a new development platform.  The
	highlights of this new development platform are:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>A runtime environment that provides garbage
		  collection, threading and a virtual machine
		  specification (The Virtual Execution System, VES)</li>

		<li>A comprehensive class library. </li>

		<li>A new language, C#.  Very similar to Java,  C#
		  allows programmers to use all the features available
		  on the .NET runtime.</li>

		<li>A language specification that compilers can
		  follow if they want to generate classes and code
		  that can interoperate with other programming
		  languages (The Common Language Specification: CLS)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The Common Language Infrastructure platform is similar to the
  	goals we had in GNOME of giving language independence to
  	programmers.  It is more mature, documented, larger in scope,
  	and has a consistent design.</p>

	<p>Any API that is written using a CLS provider language can be
  	used by any language that is a CLS consumer.  Compilers
  	generate code in a format called Common Intermediate Language
  	(CIL) which is an intermediate representation of a compiled
  	program and is easy to compile to native code or compiled
  	using Just-in-Time (JIT) engines.  The restrictions placed by
  	the runtime on the CIL byte codes ensures that it is possible
  	to do a good job at optimizing the code in a JIT compiler.</p>

<h3>ECMA standards.</h3>

	<p>Microsoft has submitted the
  	specifications of C#, the runtime, the metadata and the
  	other various bits of the .NET development platform to the
  	<a href="http://www.ecma.ch">ECMA</a> for standarization.</p>

	<p>You can get a copy of the specifications submitted to ECMA
	from: <a href="http://www.dotnetexperts.com/ecma">http://www.dotnetexperts.com/ecma</a></p>

<h3>Mono: an Open Source Common Language Infrastructure implementation. </h3>

	<p>Ximian has begun work on Mono, a project that aims to bring
  	the Common Language Infrastructure platform to free systems.  </p>

	<p>The .NET development platform is a very rich, powerful, and
  	well designed platform that would help improve the free
  	software development platform.  Just like the GNU project
  	began to clone Unix sixteen years ago, we will be cloning the
  	.NET development platform because it is a great platform to
  	build on.</p>
