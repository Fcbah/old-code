<h2>Execute</h2>
Dont forget the .exe! 
<pre class="console">
mono &lt;application<b>.exe</b>&gt;
</pre>
TODO: This is the printout of "man mono". It must be organized. 
<h2>Options</h2>
<h3>--help , -h</h3>
Displays usage instructions. 
<h3>--share-code</h3>
This mode makes the LoaderOptimization for Application Domains
default to sharing code. This results in slower code, but enables
code sharing across appli- cation domains. The default is to
maximize for speed, but disallow JITed code sharing across domains.
See System.LoaderOptimization for more information 
<h3>--config filename</h3>
Load the specified configuration file instead of the default
one(s). The default files are /etc/mono/config and ~/.mono/config
or the file specified in the MONO_CONFIG environment variable, if
set. 
<h3>--noinline</h3>
Disables the code inliner. 
<h2>DEBUGGING OPTIONS</h2>
The following options are used to debug, or perfo- mance test the
JIT compiler: 
<h3>--trace-calls</h3>
Shows method names as they are invoked. 
<h3>--dump-asm</h3>
Displays the generated code as methods are invoked. 
<h3>--dump-forest</h3>
Displays the basic blocks and the forest of trees that is created
from a stream of CIL opcodes. 
<h3>--compile name</h3>
Compiles the method on the given class (names-
pace.name:methodname) or all classes in the given image
(@imagename). 
<h3>--ncompile</h3>
Compiles the method a number of times. If no argu- ment is
specified, the method will be compiled a thousand times. 
<h2>DEVELOPMENT OPTIONS</h2>
The following options are used to debug a JITed applica- tion.
They're only useful when running the JIT in a debugger: 
<h3>--debug</h3>
Writes out debug information in the given format or in the default
format. See DEBUGGING FORMATS for details. 
<h3>--debug-args args</h3>
Comma-separated list of additional arguments for the symbol writer.
See DEBUGGING FORMATS for details. 
<h3>--break method</h3>
Inserts a breakpoint before the method whose name is `method'
(namespace.class:methodname). Use `Main' as method name to insert a
breakpoint on the application's main method. 
<h3>--precompile name</h3>
Compiles the given class (namespace.name), method
(namespace.name:methodname) or all classes in the given image
(@imagename) before executing the main application. 
<h3>--profile</h3>
Collect profiling information and dump it at the end of the
process. 
<h2>DEBUGGING FORMATS</h2>
The following debugging formats are currently supported: stabs
Writes out stabs debug information. dwarf Writes out dwarf debug
information. mono Use a symbol file which has been created by MCS.
It can be used to get source lines in stack traces. The "stabs" and
"dwarf" formats support the following options: 
<h3>filename=FILENAME</h3>
Write debugging information into FILENAME. This file must be run
through the assembler to create an object file. 
<h3>objfile=FILENAME</h3>
When automatically assembling the symbol file, write the resulting
object file into FILENAME. 
<h3>dont_assemble</h3>
Normally, the symbol file is automatically assem- bled to an object
file when you call "mono_debug_make_symbols". Use this option to
dis- able this behaviour. 
<h3>install_il_files</h3>
Put the generated *.il files in the same directory than the
assembly they came from. The default is to put them into the
current working directory. 
<h3>dont_update_il_files</h3>
Normally, the *.il files are recreated if their assemblies have
changed when you call "mono_debug_make_symbols". Use this option to
dis- able this behaviour. 
<h3>dont_create_il_files</h3>
Update the *.il files if their assemblies have changed, but only if
the file already exists.
