  <h1>Additional Development Tools</h1>

  <p>
    As you might expect, there are many development tools available to
    C# developers, ranging from bare-bones text editors to complex
    integrated development environments. 
    
  </p>

  <h2><a id="enacs-or-vim">Using Emacs or Vim</a></h2>

<p> 
Emacs and Vim are general purpose text editors, not IDEs designed for use
with .NET and C#. However, you can use them to write software in nearly any language. 
</p>

<p>
For Emacs, you will want to use the C# major mode available at <a
href="http://davh.dk/script/">davh.dk</a> or <a
href="http://www.cybercom.net/~zbrad/DotNet/Emacs/">www.cybercom.net</a>
to handle syntax coloring and proper indentation.  </p>

<p>
  Vim supports syntax highlighting for C#, but not much else.
</p>

<h2>Eclipse in C# Mode</h2>

<p>
  The <a href="http://eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> project is better known
for its Java IDE, and is in fact written in Java.  However, it is a
full-featured development environment which can be used with plugins
for many other languages, including C#. </p>


<p>
  To use Eclipse with Mono, you will need to install a Java Runtime
Environment from <a
href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/linux130/?dwzone=java">IBM</a>
or <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/download-linux.html">Sun</a>,
and you will also need the <a
href="http://www.improve-technologies.com/alpha/esharp/">C# Plugin
from Improve Technologies.</a>
</p>

<p> 
Once all three pieces are installed, consult the Eclipse C# plugin
documentation for instructions on how to proceed.
