<p>The Mono Handbook is for:</p>
<ul>
	<li>.NET developers who want to learn how to use the Mono tools</li>
	<li>Windows developers who want to learn about GNOME 2 application development</li>
	<li>Developers from UNIX, Linux and Macintosh platforms who want to learn about .NET programming</li>
</ul>


<p>
The Mono handbook does not include an introduction to C#, because there are
good C# manuals already available. While this guide aims to be useful to all
readers, if you are not already familiar with development procedures or with
the C# language you will want to consult <a
href="appendencies/resources.html">Appendix C, Links to other Resources</a> for
information not covered here.
