<p>
The control structs are the statements the language offers you to
have the control over your application. They are used for
mantain a more logical behavior inside the program.
</p>
<p>
There are differente kind of them: conditional ( they decide if
an action or other must be taken ); repetitive ( certain group of
actions to be taken n times ); and so on.
</p>
<p>
Without control structs, any application would be so boring and so
useless. Understanding the control structs is a fundamental part
of the learning of any programming language.
