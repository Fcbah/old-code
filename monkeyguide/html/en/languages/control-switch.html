Sometimes the actions to be taken depend on the value of a variable
or field. Imagine you want to print a different message depending in a 
variable, and that variable can have a different value in large range. You could
write various nested if/else statements, but there is another conditional
control struct called <b>switch</b>.
</p>
<p>
The <b>switch</b> control struct looks for a certain value, and take a certain
action depending on that value. Observe, however, that <b>switch</b> depends
on a variable, and can not be used around a simple decision ( a boolean value ). Based on that fact,
we can say, for example,  that for a <b>bool</b> variable it should be much better to use
a if or if/else stament than a <b> switch</b> one, since its range is from true to false.
</p>
<p>
Enough generalities. The struct of a <b>switch</b> looks like this:
<pre class="code">
 	switch ( <i>variable</i> ) {

		case value1:<i>actions</i>
				break;
		case value2:<i>actions</i>
				break;
		...
		case value-n:<i></i>
				break;
		default:<i>alternative actions</i>
			break;

	}

</pre>
After the <b>switch</b> word, you must write each posibility with a <b>case</b> sub-section, then
two periods, actions to be taken ( note that the brackets are not neccesary ) and the reserved word
<b>break</b> ( this control struct will be covered in the next sub chapters, but it is enought to
say that it marks the end of a sub section ). Observe the 
last section:
<pre class="code">
		 default:<i>alternative actions</i>
                        break;
</pre>
This section, the <b>default</b> one, is reached when the value of the variable is different to
all the posibilities in the statement. The other important thing is the
<b>break</b> reserved word. This words tells the environment to stop
checking at the other posibilites ( don't forget to write it after the
actions in each <i>case</i>).
</p>
<p>
For instance, an example of the use of a <b>switch</b> statement would be one like the next:
<pre class="code">

	string name = "Carlos";

	switch ( name ) {

		case "Carlos":Console.WriteLine("You are an apprentice");
			break;
		case "Duncan":Console.WriteLine("You are a journeyer");
			break;
		case "Federico":Console.WriteLine("You are a master ! ");
			break;
		default:Console.WriteLine("I can't stablish your range, cause I don't know who you are.");
			break;

	}

</pre>
With this section clearer, let's write a small sample. Our application
will receive a int value, and will try to print the roman representation. But our
program can only traduce elements from 1 to 5, so, if the number is out of range,
it will print a error message.
</p>
<p>
<pre class="code">
//
// A sample of the switch statement
//

using System;

 public class SwitchTest {

	public static void Main ()
	{

		int number;

		// Get the number from the user
		Console.WriteLine("Hello. Write a number from 1 to 5 : ");
		number = Convert.ToInt32( Console.ReadLine()  );

		switch ( number ) {

                        case 1:Console.WriteLine("I");
                               break;
                        case 2:Console.WriteLine("II");
                               break;
                        case 3:Console.WriteLine("III");
                               break;
                        case 4:Console.WriteLine("IV");
                               break;
                        case 5:Console.WriteLine("V");
                               break;
                        default:Console.WriteLine("Number out of range ");
                                break;

                }


	}

 }

</pre>
Save, compile and run it. You should see something like this:
<pre class="console">
$ mono switch.exe
Hello. Write a number from 1 to 5 :
2
II

$ mono switch.exe
Hello. Write a number from 1 to 5 :
11
Number out of range
</pre>
And yes, it prints the roman number, if it is in the range. If not,
call for the <b>default</b> sub-section ( in this case, a error message ).
