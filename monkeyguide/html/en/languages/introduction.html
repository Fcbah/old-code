This tutorial is an exercise in writing a Handbook for beginning
programmers, that have not yet programmed with any programming
language or with any OO language. It might very well get boring to
others, but for those, a short tutorial is offered. Also I'm sure a
C/C++/Java programmer can learn C# by reading some samples and
writing some code. 
<p>So, if the following question bores you, please go to the short
C# introduction.</p>
<p><i>Many thanks go to Dirk Louis for his german book "Jetzt lerne
ich C#". While I have not copied it, it was a big help on howto
write something for a newbe programmer. We sometimes forget and
write to complicated.</i></p>
