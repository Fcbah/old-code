<h2>For</h2>
<p>
For statement is an important iterative statement. It is used to do
a secuence of actions certain number of times. This has a similar behavior
to the <b>while</b> and <b>do-while</b> statements, but has it own properties.
First of all, its structure is the next:
<pre class="code">
 for ( loop variables declaration; condition; actualization of the loop variables ) {
	// actions to be
	// done
 }
</pre>
So in the first section there is the <i>loop variables declaration</i>. This variables
are used to control the times of the iterative statement, because their values are
used both in the loop behavior and in the condition(s) (most of the times, the loop variables
will be used because of the condition). However, most of the times you will only require a variable.
The next section is the condition area: its purpose is to contain a set of conditions to be
checked before the next iteration is executed. Maybe you want to execute some sentences until
a int variable called n has a value minor than 10. Finally, the last area is the actualization: here
you have to <i>reload</i> your loop variables, and then avoid the infinite execution of the <b>for</b>
statement.
</p>
<p>
A normal <b>for</b> statement is shown below. It executes the block of sentences if the condition is 
true (this is checked in every iteration, just like it happens in the <b>while</b> and <b>do-while</b>
statements). A int variable (i) is initialized to 1, the condition stablishes that the variable i must be less
than 10. Finally, in the actualization we only increment in 1 the variable i.
<pre class="code">
 for (int i = 1; i &#60;= 10; i++)
	Console.WriteLine ("{0} * {1} = {2}", 11, i, 11 * i);
</pre>
Here the instructions is executed 10 times. Every time it multiply 11 by the current value of
i. The results would be:
<pre class="console">
11 * 1 = 11
11 * 2 = 22
11 * 3 = 33
11 * 4 = 44
11 * 5 = 55
11 * 6 = 66
11 * 7 = 77
11 * 8 = 88
11 * 9 = 99
11 * 10 = 110
</pre>
The process is something like this: the initial value of i is 1, and the condition will bye satisfied until i will take
a value greater than 10. So, after the execution of the sentence, i increments in 1. So, that sentence in the loop
will be executed while the i variable has a value minor or equal to 10. So, when i has the value of 11, the condition is unsatisfied,
and thus the <b>for</b> loop finishes.
</p>
<p>
After going to the last example, it's important to make note a pair of things. The first is that you can avoid some for section.
If, for example, you don't want to put variable initialization (because you are using an external one or because you
want it to avoid the use of the variable), the you have only to write the respective semi-colon. And the second: the variable of
the loop will only exist during the loop execution. After that, you cannot use it (the only way to do that is using a previously
declared variable).
</p>
<p>
Finally, we'll use a boring algorithm that looks for the prime numbers. For that purpose,
we will try to check if they are divisible by the primes ones (if they aren't). 
</p>
<p>
<b>* Primes are those numbers that are only divisable by themselves and by 1.</b>

<pre class="code">

                 for (int i = 1; i &#60; top; i++) {
			 // The first primes
                         if (i == 1 || i == 2 || i == 3 || i == 5 || i == 7 || i == 11)
                                 Console.WriteLine (i);
			 // The other primes. If they are not, don't print them
                         else if (i % 2 != 0 &#38;&#38; i % 3 != 0 &#38;&#38; i % 5 != 0 &#38;&#38; i % 7 != 0 &#38;&#38; i % 11 != 0)
                                 Console.WriteLine (i);

                 }

         }

}

<p>
Compile and run it. The next message should be printed:
</p>
<pre class="console">
1
2
3
5
7
11
13
17
19
23
29
31
37
41
43
47
53
59
61
67
71
73
79
83
89
97
</pre>
<p>
The for iterates from the number 1 to the 100, and in every integer it executes some actions. The actions are, then,
testing if the current number wheter is or not a prime number.
