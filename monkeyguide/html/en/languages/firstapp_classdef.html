Normally a program consists of several expressions one after the
other. In Perl you would simply write those expressions: 
<pre class="code">
printf("Hello World!");
</pre>
C# is different. All code must be organized in methods, which 
always need to be contained in classes. It is pointless to ask why
this is, now, it will be explained later.
<p>Instead let's just create that class:</p>
<pre class="code">
class Hello{
}
</pre>

</body>
