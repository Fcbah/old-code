<p>
When you define a class, you have to decide who will have the permission.
Here we find the access modifiers, which are reserved keywords used for
specifying the access level. The way they are used is:
<pre class="code">
 [access modifier] element ...
</pre>
The access modifiers are avalaible for most of the elements in the C# language:
fields, methods, arrays, etc., even the classes.
</p>
<h3>Public</h3>
<p>
This is the first you will see. With this modifier, you are giving anyone the
permission for accessing your element. For example, lets remember our MyClass class:
<pre class="code">
 <b>public</b> int GetResult ( int n ) 
 ...
</pre>
Note the <b>public</b> word. So, any element outside of the class will be able
to work with it. Actually, a good class design will never make public any field,
and you should avoid it, making public other elements, such your methods. If you want
to access your fields, do it throughout a property.
</p>
<h3>Private</h3>
<p>
With <b>private</b>, you will guarantee that your elements wont'be avalaible for any
extern element. In fact, they are only avalaible for your intern elements. This is how you should
declare your fields. An example would be:
<pre class="code">
 <b>private</b> int MyField;
</pre>
Note that our MyField field was declared as private. If, for example, you try to access it,
then you'll get an compilation error message. By the way, the default access modifier for
the elements in a class ( this is, when you don't put any access modifier to a specified element )
is private.
</p>
<h3>Protected</h3>
<p>
When you derive a class ( this is, you have a general class and want another one to
inherit its elements and add some more specific ), if you previous elements were defined as
<b>private</b>, you won't be able to access them. To solve this problem, we use the <b>protected</b>
modifier:
<pre class="code">
 // Our general class
 class GeneralClass {

 	private int a;
	protected int b;
 
 }

 // Our extended class
 class ExtendedClass : GeneralClass {

 	// Let's modify the fields in the constructor
 	this.a = 10; // Error !
	this.b = 10; // perfect!
 	
 }
</pre>

if you don't understand very well the inheritance, don't worry, only try to see this as if you
understand this, and after the inheritance section, go back to understand perfect this modifier.
