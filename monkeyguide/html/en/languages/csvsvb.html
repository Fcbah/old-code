Rewrote because this section was *very* anti-VB.
-->

<p>Because the CLI is designed to be language independent, all languages
can use code that is written in another language. This leaves the question
"Which language should I write in?" The simple answer is "It does not matter".</p>

<p>The two primary managed languages are C# and Visual Basic.NET (VB.NET). Both languages
have very similar syntax. So why would you choose one over another? If you have a Java/C/C++ background,
you may find that C# has a familiar syntax. On the other hand, if you have programed in Visual Basic, you
will feel at home in VB.NET. Which ever language you choose, you will have the power of the BCL behind you, making
both languages excellent choices.</p>
