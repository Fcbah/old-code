<body>
The first Line is a comment: 
<pre class="code">
// Hello World! - Our first Program
</pre>
Comments are ignored by the compiler and should help you or others
to understand your code. Comments can be marked as such by either
putting two slashes in each line, or by using "/* comment here */. 
<pre class="code">
// This is a comment
// over two lines

/* This is a comment, 
   over
   many lines, without
   marking each one */
</pre>
You should not use Comments for explaining your program, it will
explain itself.
