<h2>Do while</h2>
<p>
<b>Do while</b> is a iterative statement, just like <b>while</b> or <b>for</b>. It has a behavior
very similar to the <b>while</b> one, and thus very similar. Its structur is:
<pre class="code">

 do {
	// actions to be taken
	// while the the condition is true
	//
 } while ( condition );

</pre>
It can be said that the while and <b>do-while</b> statements work the same way. The only difference
is that in the <b>while</b> statement, the condition is checked <i>before</i> the sentences are executed
(and thus the block can not be executed never), and in the <b>do-while</b> statement, the condition is checked <i>after</i>
the first execution of the sentences.
</p>
<p>
A little sample will show the difference between the two statements. In this program, we will run
<b>while</b> and a <b>do-while</b> statements. The condition will be : is the integer n minor than 10?
</p>
<p>
<pre class="code">
//
// ========================================================
// A first sample showing the difference between the use of
// the do-while and while statements
// ========================================================
//

using System;

 public class DoWhileSample {

         public static void Main ()
         {

                 int number = 11;

                 //
                 // WHILE statement - condition false
                 //
		 while (number &#60; 10) {
                         Console.WriteLine (number);
                         number++;
                 }

                 //
                 // DO-WHILE statement - condition false
		 // but sentences executed at least one time
                 //
                 do {
                         Console.WriteLine (number);
                         number++;
                 } while (number &#60; 10);

         }

 }
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Next, compile it and run it:
<pre class="console">
$ mono do-while.exe
11
$
</pre>
As seen, the sentences in the <b>do-while</b> loop will be executed for first time even the condition is false
(this is caused because the revision of the condition after the block of sentences).
</p>
<p>
The conclusion is: use the <b>do-while</b> statement when you need the funcionality
of the <b>while</b> one, but need to execute the sentence(s) at least one time.
