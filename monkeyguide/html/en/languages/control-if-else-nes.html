Sometimes it is neccesary to take an action to more than one alternative.
For this purpose we have the nested If/else statement. You can combine as you want,
but a sample could be:
<pre class="code">
 if ( condition ) 
	if ( condition2 )
		action to be taken if condition1 and condition2 are true
	else
		alternative to condition2, but condition1 true
 else
	if ( condition3 )
		alternative to false values to condition1 and condition2,
		but condition3 true
</pre>
As you can see, it is only that, as part of the actions to be taken, we apply again
a <b>if</b> statement. it is even possible to avoid the else part, like the sample shows.
Only be careful with the <b>else</b> statements: each one correspond to the previous one <b>if</b>
( observe carefully the sample ). By the way, there is another way to "position" the nested if/else
statements:
<pre class="code">
 if ( condition1 )
 	action to taken for condition1
 else if ( condition2 )
	action to be taken for condition2
 else if ( condition3 )
	action to be taken for condition3

</pre>
Note that this last way is a "recursive" one ( try to indent it as the first, and you will see it ).

Coding is better than talking; let's write a small sample about the nested if/else statement: 
we want to receive a student note, ina range from 0 to 10, from bad to good ( a 0 would be a bad
note, and a 10 would be an excellent one ).
</p>
<p>
<pre class="code">
//
// A nested if/else sample
//

using System;

 public class IfElseSample {

	public static void Main ()
	{

		double note;

		// Read and convert the user input to a double,
		// using the public static Convert.ToDouble method
		Console.Write(" Enter the note ( from 0 to 10 ) : ");
		note = Convert.ToDouble( Console.ReadLine() );

		// Take an action:
		// 1) 11 or bigger, or -1 or minor, out of range
		// 2) 8 to 10 - Excellent
		// 3) 5 to 7 - Regular
		// 4) 4 or minor - Bad

		if ( note &#62; 10 || note &#60; 0 )
			Console.WriteLine("Note out of range ::");
		else
			if ( note &#62; 7 )
				Console.WriteLine("Excellent note ::");
			else
				if ( note &#62; 4 )
					Console.WriteLine("Regular note ::");
				else
					// Here we don't need more
					// data validation
					Console.WriteLine("Bad note ::");

	}

 }

</pre>
Save, compile and run it. Note that I used the "common" indentation way, for learning purposes.
You should get something like this ( user input in italics ):
<pre class="console">
$ mono if-else-nested.exe
Enter the note ( from 0 to 10 ) : <i>11</i>
Note out of range ::

$ mono if-else-nested.exe
Enter the note ( from 0 to 10 ) : <i>8</i>
Excellent note ::

$  mono if-else-nested.exe
Enter the note ( from 0 to 10 ) : <i>5</i>
Regular note ::
