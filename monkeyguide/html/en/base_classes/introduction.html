<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
There is a theorial base for the use of Collections and Dymaical Arrays, that
establishes the features of every group of objects defined in a certain API (in this case,
the Mono Library). These features are all defined using interfaces and abstract classes
that the well defined data-structures object must implement. Then it is possible to find
a second stage, the design oriented to the data structures avalaible in other languages and
architectures (like linked lists, graphs and so on).
</p>
<p>
The most general agroupation of object is called <i><b>Collection</b></i>, and this is only
formed by certains objects. An example of a collection is a group of fruits in a
store. A soecial collection, called <i><b>List</b></i> is defined as a group of elements that
can be indexed. The special feature of this group is that there must be a way to access
and sort the elements in a certain order. An example would be a group of identifiers 
in the data base of a sport club, refering each one to a member. Another special collection,
<i><b>Map/Dictionary</b></i>, uses to be a group in which every element has an associated value and an associated
key. Note that it is similar to the <i>List</i>, with the only difference that the identifier,
called <i>key</i> trends to be a more complex element than an integer -such a string-.
</p>
<p>
Thus the <i><b>List</b></i> and <i><b>Map/Dictionary</b></i> are special kinds of 
<i><b>Collection</b></i>s. Below a table describes the differences between them.
