<p>
  ASP.NET support is divided in two pieces:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Web Forms (Web Applications infrastructure).</li>

    <li>Web Services (the SOAP-based rpc system). </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Both are fully functional at this point. And many publicly available
  applications such as IBuySpy, nGallery and many others are known to
  work.  Some projects have been <a
  href="http://www.go-mono.com/ports">ported</a> to work on Mono, while
  others work out of the box.
</p>

<p>
   Web Services stack is being used for commercial applications such
  as SourceGear's Vault. They even funded the development of our Web
  Services classes back in 2002. Another example is OpenLink's
  Virtuoso. People from OpenLink also contributed to Mono.
</p>

<h2>Using ASP.NET with Mono</h2>

<p>We provide three different mechanisms for hosting ASP.NET applications:</p>

<ul>
    <li>XSP: A light-weight web server written in C#.</li>

    <li>mod_mono: An Apache module that works with both 1.3 and 2.0 versions. </li>

    <li>Roll-your-own: The class libraries allow you to roll your own
web server to dispatch web applications.  We do not cover this.</li>

</ul>

<h3>XSP</h3>

<p>XSP is a simple web server written in C# that can be used to run your
ASP.NET applications. The code is available from our download page or
from the Anonymous CVS repository (module name: xsp). A couple of
classes of this new server can be reused/extended to make an apache
module/cgi using mono (MonoWorkerRequest and
MonoApplicationHost). This server also uses a couple of plugins
distributed with Mono to support gzip HTTP transfers.</p>

<p>There is also a set of pages, controls and web services that you
can use to test the server and see how ASP.NET looks like.</p>

<p>As XSP is written in C# and uses System.Web classes to perform its
job, it also works under MS runtime.  </p>

<h3>mod_mono</h3>

<p>This Apache module is available from our download page.</p>

<p>The module requires the XSP program to be installed, as it reuses a
lot of the functionality.  Please follow the mod_mono installation
instructions available on the package.</p>
 
<p>It does not work on Windows. </p>
