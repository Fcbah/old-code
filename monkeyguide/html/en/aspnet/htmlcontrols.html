<h2>Introduction</h2>
HTML Controls are in most WebDevelopment Enviroments treated as
text and controlled through the Output. This is a big step back
compared to Client-side programming. This is the point, where the
power of ASP.NET becomes clear.
<p>How would you create a link to the main page from a variable?
Traditionally like that:</p>
<pre class="code">
&amp;lta href="&lt;% Response.Write(mainpage); %&gt;"&gt;Link to Main page&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>
This leads to unreadable, and code difficult to maintain. ASP.NET
provides a very, very elegant solution. 
<h3>Welcome Objects!</h3>
Like in Gtk#, or System.Windows.Forms many HTML controls are
accessible as objects. Their properties can be easily changed.
ASP.NET generates pure HTML at runtime. 
<pre class="code">
void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) 
{ 
   anchor1.HRef = mainpage;
}

&lt;form runat="server"&gt;

&amp;lta id="anchor1" runat="server"&gt;Link to Main page&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/form&gt;
</pre>
Is there to say anything more? This code looks much, much cleaner
and does do exactly the same. Web Pages have finally caught up with
Client programming. This chapter will introduce all controls and
provide examples.
