<h1>What is .NET?</h1>

<p> The term ".NET" can be terribly confusing, because it represents a
software development platform, several services, and a marketing and
product branding initiative. In this guide, we will use it only in the
sense of the software development platform.  That development platform
is distinguished in several important ways:</p>


<p>
Perhaps the most important aspect of .NET is that it it is language
independent. Other platforms offer one-way interoperation: GNOME
libraries, written in C, can be accessed from Python, but that Python
code cannot be accessed by other C applications. With the .NET
framework, developers can mix languages and reuse code in any direction.
</p>

<p>
.NET is also platform independent. As with Java, you can copy
compiled bytecode from one platform to another and run it
anywhere. Note that while you can access native system resources from
.NET, their usage may limit you to platforms on which those resources
are available.  </p>


<p>
 .NET also has an extensive basic class library, starting with
high-level classes like XML-Support, Database-Support,
WebServices-Support and Webpages-Support. With the .NET class library,
you can develop new applications and extend existing ones easily and
quickly.  </p>


<p> Finally, .NET gives you access to the C# ("C Sharp") language, a
clean and effective tool for developing in .NET and other
frameworks. You'll see plenty of examples of C# code throughout this
guide, but if you want a complete introduction, see Appendix C, <a
