<h1> What is Mono?</h1> 

	<p>Mono is a project that delivers an implementation of the .NET
	Framework (standardized by ECMA) and extensions across a wide
	range of operating systems and CPU architectures.</p>

	<p>The standards are the ECMA 334 and 335.</p>

	<p>We like this platform, because it helps developing software in
	less time: reduce the cost of development, improve maintenance
	and increases the fun, by taking care of the low-level boring
	details, and allowing programmers to focus on innovation.</p>

	<p>Currently Linux, Unix, Windows, MacOS and other embedded
	systems as the host OS, and Intel, PPC, Sparc, ARM and HPPA as
	the host CPUs.</p>

	<p>The effort contains the basics:</p>

	<blockquote>
	
		<p>C# compiler, a virtual machine, an advanced code
		generation engine (for just-in-time compilation and
		pre-compilation of code).</p>

		<p>Class libraries to support ASP.NET WebForms,
		WebServices, ADO.NET databases and Windows.Forms</p>

		<p>Mono, Unix or Gnome specific libraries.</p>

	</blockquote>

	<p>But we have not limited ourselves to implementing the
	Microsoft APIs.  Mono ships with various libraries that
	exploit features unique to Unix, Gnome and free software.</p>

	<p>Conceptually:</p>

	<img src="two-stacks.png"/>


	<p>For instance we developed support for developing desktop
	applications on Unix/Linux with Gtk+ and Gnome, and we support
	the latest technologies from Freedesktop.org like Cairo and we
	also provide Mozilla bindings to create powerful desktop
	applications that reuse this engine.  All of these greatly
	simplifies app development on the Linux desktop. </p>

	<p>We support third-party databases (Postgress, MySQL, DB2,
	Sybase, SqlLite), support for standard compliant directory
	services (LDAP), and we do not limit ourselves to Xml Schema,
	we have validators and readers for Relax-NG based systems as
	well.</p>

	<p>So Mono has not limited itself to providing a path for Windows
	developers to try out Linux, but we also integrate with the
	Linux/Unix ecosystem.</p>
	
<h2>The Importance of a free implementation of the ECMA standards</h2>

	<p>There are various reasons. </p>

	<p>Today the .NET/ECMA virtual machine is one of the most
	advanced commercial VMs available, and we want to bring the
	benefits of this virtual machine to Linux developers.  To
	allow Linux to compete in the marketplace in terms of
	programmer productivity.</p>

	<p>It is also key to allow Windows developers to support more
	than one platform with their codebase, instead of requiring
	them to rewrite their code to support Linux or the Mac: they
	can share the engine of their applications, and port their GUI
	to native libraries: Gtk on Linux, and Cocoa on Mac, while
	keeping all of their code in C# and obtaining the benefits of
	this rich VM and all of the class libraries available for
	them.</p>

	<p>In a way, you get to reuse your knowledge, your experience,
	your staff to support more platforms, and you can reduce your
	costs of development.</p>

<h2>State of Mono 1.0</h2>

	<p>Mono 1.0 includes the execution environment, the C#
	compiler, the pre-compiler, JIT engine and associated
	libraries.</p>

	<p>The ASP.NET WebForms, ASP.NET Web Services, ADO.NET, Remoting,
	serialization, DirectoryServices are all functional and being
	used in a day-to-day basis.  </p>

	<p>The major components that will not ship in the Mono 1.0 time
	frame are Code Access Security (CAS),  Windows.Forms and
	EnterpriseServices (which we are not likely to support at any
	point) nor support for COM components.  </p>

	<p>COM is not wildly used in Unix, only a few apps use it, and
	when they do, its their own version of COM (Mozilla and
	OpenOffice), so we have no plans at this point for that.</p>

	<p>People might want to read the Mono Roadmap, which is
	available in <a
	href="http://www.go-mono.com/mono-roadmap.html">http://www.go-mono.com/mono-roadmap.html</a>
	this document contains the precise plans for Mono 1.0 and 1.1
	and what will be available on each release.</p>

<h2>Mono and Licensing</h2>

	<p>The Mono runtime is licensed under the terms of the GNU
	LGPL, but it is also available under a commercial license for
	those who want to add proprietary extensions to the virtual
	machine.</p>

	<p>The Mono Compilers (C#, VB.NET) are licensed under the
	terms of the GNU GPL.</p>

	<p>The Mono class libraries are licensed under the terms of
	the MIT X11 license, which is a very lax open source license.</p>
