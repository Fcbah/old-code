  <h2>Mono and Linux Adoption</h2>

  <p>Linux's lack of applications can be linked to its stagnating set
  of development tools.  Although Linux is hugely successful to run
  server applications it has not thrived as a platform for developers.</p>

  <p>When moving to Linux developers have to face a new environment, a
  new set of APIs, the lack of portability for any of their code, 
  an unfamiliar set of tools and a disparate and non-coherent
  development platform.  </p>

  <p>The Open Source culture does not take binary nor backwards
  compatibility as an important attribute and goes against some of
  their principles.   This is something that we as a company have to
  take very seriously if we want developers to support Linux: software
  developed today should run in 20 years without modification.</p>

  <p>.NET -and by extension Mono- have been designed to work in this
  scenario.</p>

  <h2>Mono and Linux adoption: Server</h2>

  <b>
  <ul>
    <li>Deploy ASP.NET web servers and web services on Linux.</li>
    <li>Leverages Linux security, reliability and low-cost.</li>
    <li>Reuse third-party controls, components and applications on
  Linux.</li>
  </ul>
  </b>

  <p>Mono enables developers to bring server-side applications that
  have been developed with the Microsoft .NET Framework over to Unix
  servers.  </p>

  <p>Today Windows users have a choice of platform for
  enterprise applications: Sun's J2EE platform and Microsoft's .NET
  platform, while Linux/Unix users have been limited to only use Sun's
  J2EE platform.</p>

  <p>With Mono developers can use their existing Windows development
  tools and deploy on clusters of Linux servers.  </p>

  <h2>Mono and Linux adoption: Desktop</h2>

  <b>
    <ul>
      <li>Increase development productivity.</li>
      <li>Bring Windows ISVs to Linux Desktop.</li>
      <li>Reuse third-party tools, controls, components and applications on Linux.</li>
      <li>Support both Windows and Linux: share code.</li>
    </ul>
  </b>

  <p>The success of the Linux platform is tied to having an
  encompassing development platform.</p>

  <p>Unlike the server side where the development platform is fairly
  complete, the Linux client side development is either not as mature,
  or the fragmentation of libraries has made it very hard to have a
  unified development stack.  Various libraries can be used to build
  applications but the result is a very diverse quilt of technologies
  and methodologies, often leading to instabilities, dependencies and
  wasted hours of debugging time.</p>

  <p>The Mono platform has one advantage: since it is relatively new
  it has been able to absorb all of today's needs into a unified
  platform with a unified programming model and brings a lot of
  clarity to today's development platform.  </p>

  <p>Mono delivers high productivity gains for desktop developers by
  providing a best-of-practices runtime.  By providing the tools to
  create modern applications a safe development environment, garbage
  collection and thread-safe.  </p>

  <p>The C# language incorporates various concepts that are normally
  used in GUI application development directly into the language as
  first-class language constructs like events, delegates, properties
  and attributes.</p>

  <p>The addition of Visual Basic and Windows.Forms (Q4/2004) to Mono
  will also help migrate this important group of developers from the
  Windows platform to Linux.</p>
