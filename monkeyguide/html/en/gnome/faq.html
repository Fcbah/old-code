<h3><a name="1.1" id="1.1"></a>1.1 &#160;What is Gtk#?</h3>
Gtk# brings the power and ease of .Net development paradigms to the
free software GUI application development community. &#160;Gtk#
provides a C source parser and C# code generator which can be used
to produce .Net assemblies that bind to GObject based libraries.
&#160;Among the libraries currently wrapped are gtk, gdk, atk,
pango, gda, gnomedb, gconf, libgnomecanvas, libgnomeui, and
libglade.<br />
<br />
<h3><a name="1.2" id="1.2"></a>1.2 &#160;Why isn't it called Gnome#
or Gnome.Net?</h3>
When the project was started, the idea was to wrap the Gtk+
libraries with a set of C# classes. &#160;It quickly became
apparent that the source parser and C# code generator could be used
to wrap any GObject based API. &#160;Contributors started wrapping
their favorite GNOME libraries. &#160;Mailing lists and a
sourceforge project were already open under the gtk-sharp
nomenclature and no compelling technical reasons for renaming
presented themselves.&#160; The decision was made to continue under
the Gtk# name, even though the binding encompasses more than just
Gtk, and more than just C#.<br />
<br />
<h3><a name="2.1" id="2.1"></a>2.1 &#160;What are the Dependencies
to build Gtk# on X11 platforms?</h3>
You'll need a .Net framework installed. Gtk# has been successfully
used with both the <a href="http://www.go-mono.org">mono</a> and
<a href="http://www.southern-storm.com.au/portable_net.html">Portable.Net</a>
frameworks. The bare minimum requirement is a complete installation
of the Gtk+-2.0 libraries. &#160;Keep in mind that if your Gtk+
installation is provided by binary packages, you will also need to
install the *-devel packages. &#160;If you have additional
GNOME-2.0 libraries installed, the configure script will detect
their presence and the associated wrappers will be built. &#160;A
summary of the libraries which will be built is printed at the end
of the configure step.<br />
<br />
<h3><a name="2.2" id="2.2"></a>2.2 &#160;What about building on
Win32 platforms?</h3>
To build Gtk# on win32, you will need a working
<a href="http://www.cygwin.com">cygwin</a> installation. &#160;Keep
in mind that the default cygwin installation may not have all the
tools you need. &#160;Cygwin provides the gnu make tool which
builds the Gtk# library. &#160;You will also need the mingw-gcc
compiler installed in order to build the Gtk# glue library.
&#160;There are binary packages of the Gtk+-2.0 libs and
dependencies available from the
<a href="http://www.gimp.org/%7Etml/gimp/win32/">Gtk+ for Win32
project page</a>. &#160;You will also need these libraries
installed, along with their devel packages in order to build the
glue library. &#160;Once you have this environment set up, expand
the gtk-sharp source into a directory and in a Cygwin shell window,
cd to the gtk-sharp directory and execute the command "make -f
makefile.win32". <br />
<br />
<h3><a name="3.1" id="3.1"></a>3.1 &#160;Why can't mono find
gtk-sharp.dll?</h3>
You most likely have installed Gtk# into a prefix other than where
mono is installed. &#160;In order for the runtime to locate the
Gtk# assemblies, you will need to add their location to the
MONO_PATH environment variable. For the default installation
prefix, this will mean executing the following command:<br />
<pre>
export MONO_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$MONO_PATH
</pre>
<br />
<h3><a name="3.2" id="3.2"></a>3.2 &#160;Why can't my compiler find
the Gtk# classes?</h3>
You need to provide an assembly reference in your compilation
command. This will look like "mcs /ref:gtk-sharp foo.cs" if you are
referencing classes in the Gtk or GtkSharp namespaces.<br />
