  <h1>GNOME Development with Mono</h1>


  <h2>What is Gtk#?</h2>
  <p>
    This chapter covers use of the GNOME development platform with C#
    and .NET. The breadth of features and stability of the GNOME
    development platform and the rapid development tools from .NET
    make a powerful combination, as you will see in the following
    exercises.  Among the tools available to you as a developer are
    the Glade user interface design tools, the GnomeDB database access
    system, the Gecko HTML engine from Mozilla, and the GConf
    settings registry.  That means that, for example, you can write a
    web browser in just a few lines of code, as we do in <a
    href="glade2.html">the second Glade.NET exercise.</a>
  </p>
  
  <p> 
    As we explore the use of the GNOME tools, be aware that you can
    use one library without committing yourself to the rest of them, or
    committing yourself to the GNOME desktop environment or even any
    particular OS. While Gtk# is primarily designed for development of
    Linux and UNIX applications, many of the Gtk# libraries are
    fully functional on Windows and Macintosh OS X as well. Where
    possible, examples will be cross-platform functional, and we will
    note libraries and function calls that do not translate across
    platforms.
  </p>


<h2>Installing the Gtk# Development Environment</h2>

  <p>
    The standard GNOME packages you will need are probably already
    part of your distribution. If not, you can install them from Red
    Carpet and OpenCarpet servers, package
    repositories like <a href="http://rpmfind.net">RPMFind</a> or <a
    href="http://pkg-mono.alioth.debian.org/">Debian.org</a>, or 
    with the one-step <a
    href="http://www.gnome.org/~jdub/garnome/">GARNOME</a> build script.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A comfortable base set of packages for a Linux developer would be:
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>glib and glib-devel, for basic convenience functions</li>
      <li>pango and pango-devel, for text-rendering with full UTF-8 compliance</li>
      <li>atk and atk-devel, for accessibility</li>
      <li>gtk2, gtk2-devel, gtk-sharp and gtk-sharp-devel, for the actual GUI toolkit</li>
      <li>ORBit and ORBit-devel, for CORBA object communications</li>
      <li>gtkmozembed (sometimes packaged as part of mozilla-devel), for Mozilla embedding</li>
      <li>gtksourceview and gtksourceview-devel</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you are using Monodevelop, you have most of these libraries
      already. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Windows developers will also need the <a
      href="http://cygwin.org">Cygwin</a> and mingw-cc tools.
    </p>

 
<h2>Installing the Glade Interface Builder</h2>

<p>

The Glade UI tool is not required but is strongly recommended. It is
included with most Linux distributions, and a <a
href="http://primates.ximian.com/~damon/glade/WinGlade.exe">Windows
version</a> is also available.
</p>

<p> 
The Glade application allows you to use simple drag-and-drop tools to
lay out your user interface, and then saves the UI as an XML
file. Then, with a single call to the libglade library, the user
interface is generated and attached to the data structures and
functions you have created in your code. Because user interface
generation happens at runtime, you can even adjust the UI without
recompiling.
