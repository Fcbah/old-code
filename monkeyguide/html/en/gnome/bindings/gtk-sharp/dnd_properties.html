<p>Drag data has the following properties:</p>
<p>Drag action type (ie GDK_ACTION_COPY, GDK_ACTION_MOVE).</p>
<p>Client specified arbitrary drag-and-drop type (a name and number
pair).</p>
<p>Sent and received data format type.</p>
<p>Drag actions are quite obvious, they specify if the widget can
drag with the specified action(s), e.g. GDK_ACTION_COPY and/or
GDK_ACTION_MOVE. A GDK_ACTION_COPY would be a typical drag-and-drop
without the source data being deleted while GDK_ACTION_MOVE would
be just like GDK_ACTION_COPY but the source data will be
'suggested' to be deleted after the received signal handler is
called. There are additional drag actions including GDK_ACTION_LINK
which you may want to look into when you get to more advanced
levels of drag-and-drop.</p>
<p>The client specified arbitrary drag-and-drop type is much more
flexible, because your application will be defining and checking
for that specifically. You will need to set up your destination
widgets to receive certain drag-and-drop types by specifying a name
and/or number. It would be more reliable to use a name since
another application may just happen to use the same number for an
entirely different meaning.</p>
<p>Sent and received data format types (selection target) come into
play only in your request and received data handler functions. The
term selection target is somewhat misleading. It is a term adapted
from GTK+ selection (cut/copy and paste). What selection target
actually means is the data's format type (i.e. GdkAtom, integer, or
string) that being sent or received. Your request data handler
function needs to specify the type (selection target) of data that
it sends out and your received data handler needs to handle the
type (selection target) of data received.</p>
