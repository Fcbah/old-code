<p>Let's take a look at another way of packing - Tables. These can
be extremely useful in certain situations. Using tables, we create
a grid that we can place widgets in. The widgets may take up as
many spaces as we specify. The first thing to look at, of course,
is the Table() constructor:</p>
<pre class="code">
Widget table1 = new Table(    int    rows,
                              int    columns,
                              bool   homogeneous );
</pre>
The first argument is the number of rows to make in the table,
while the second, obviously, is the number of columns. The
homogeneous argument has to do with how the table's boxes are
sized. If homogeneous is true, the table boxes are resized to the
size of the largest widget in the table. If homogeneous is false,
the size of a table boxes is dictated by the tallest widget in its
same row, and the widest widget in its column. The rows and columns
are laid out from 0 to n, where n was the number specified in the
call to Table(). So, if you specify rows = 2 and columns = 2, the
layout would look something like this: 
<pre>
 0          1          2
0+----------+----------+
 |          |          |
1+----------+----------+
 |          |          |
2+----------+----------+
</pre>
Note that the coordinate system starts in the upper left hand
corner. To place a widget into a box, use the following function: 
<pre class="code">
table1.Attach (        Widget            child,
                       int               left_attach,
                       int               right_attach,
                       int               top_attach,
                       int               bottom_attach,
                       Gtk.AttachOptions xoptions,
                       Gtk.AttachOptions yoptions,
                       int               xpadding,
                       int               ypadding );
</pre>
The first argument ("child") is the widget you wish to place in the
table. The left and right attach arguments specify where to place
the widget, and how many boxes to use. If you want a button in the
lower right table entry of our 2x2 table, and want it to fill that
entry only, left_attach would be = 1, right_attach = 2, top_attach
= 1, bottom_attach = 2. Now, if you wanted a widget to take up the
whole top row of our 2x2 table, you'd use left_attach = 0,
right_attach = 2, top_attach = 0, bottom_attach = 1. The xoptions
and yoptions are used to specify packing options and may be bitwise
OR'ed together to allow multiple options. These options are: 
<ul>
<li><b>Gtk.Fill</b> If the table box is larger than the widget, and
Gtk.Fill is specified, the widget will expand to use all the room
available.</li>
<li><b>Gtk.Shrink</b> If the table widget was allocated less space
then was requested (usually by the user resizing the window), then
the widgets would normally just be pushed off the bottom of the
window and disappear. If Gtk.Shrink is specified, the widgets will
shrink with the table.</li>
<li><b>Gtk.Expand</b> This will cause the table to expand to use up
any remaining space in the window.</li></ul>
Padding is just like in boxes, creating a clear area around the
widget specified in pixels. Gtk.Table.Attach() has a lot of
options. So, there's a shortcut: 
<pre class="code">
table1.AttachDefaults(          GtkWidget widget,
                                int       left_attach,
                                int       right_attach,
                                int       top_attach,
                                int       bottom_attach );
</pre>
The X and Y options default to Gtk.Fill | Gtk.Expand, and X and Y
padding are set to 0. The rest of the arguments are identical to
the previous function. We also have SetRowSpacing() and
SetColSpacing(). These places spacing between the rows at the
specified row or column. 
<pre class="code">
table1.SetRowSpacing(  int     row,
                       int     spacing );
</pre>
and 
<pre class="code">
table1.SetColSpacing (  int     column,
                        int     spacing );
</pre>
Note that for columns, the space goes to the right of the column,
and for rows, the space goes below the row. You can also set a
consistent spacing of all rows and/or columns with: 
<pre class="code">
table1.SetRowSpacing( int    spacing );
</pre>
And, 
<pre class="code">
table1.SetColSpacings(int     spacing );
</pre>
Note that with these calls, the last row and last column do not get
any spacing.
