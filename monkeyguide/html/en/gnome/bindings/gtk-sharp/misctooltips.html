These are the little text strings that pop up when you leave your
pointer over a button or other widget for a few seconds. They are
easy to use, so I will just explain them without giving an example.
If you want to see some code, take a look at the testgtk.cs program
distributed with Gtk#. 
<p>Widgets that do not receive events (widgets that do not have
their own window) will not work with tooltips.</p>
<p>The first call you will use creates a new tooltip. You only need
to do this once for a set of tooltips as the GtkTooltips object
this function returns can be used to create multiple tooltips.</p>
<pre class="code">
Tooltips new Tooltips();
</pre>
Once you have created a new tooltip, and the widget you wish to use
it on, simply use this call to set it: 
<pre class="code">
tooltip1.SetTip( Widget widget,
                 string tip_text,
                 string tip_private );
</pre>
The first argument is the tooltip you've already created, followed
by the widget you wish to have this tooltip pop up for, and the
text you wish it to say. The last argument is a text string that
can be used as an identifier when using GtkTipsQuery to implement
context sensitive help. For now, you can set it to null. 
<p>Here's a short example:</p>
<pre class="code">
Tooltips tooltips1;
Widget button1;
.
.
.
tooltips1 = new Tooltips();
button1 = new Button ("button 1");
.
.
.
tooltips1.SetTip(button, "This is button 1", null);
</pre>
There are other calls that can be used with tooltips. I will just
list them with a brief description of what they do. 
<pre class="code">
tooltips1.Enable();
</pre>
Enable a disabled set of tooltips. 
<pre class="code">
tooltips1.Disable();
</pre>

Disable an enabled set of tooltips. 

<p>And that's all the functions associated with tooltips. More than
you'll ever want to know :-)</p>
