The Layout container is similar to the Fixed container except that
it implements an infinite (where infinity is less than 2^32)
scrolling area. The X window system has a limitation where windows
can be at most 32767 pixels wide or tall. The Layout container gets
around this limitation by doing some exotic stuff using window and
bit gravities, so that you can have smooth scrolling even when you
have many child widgets in your scrolling area. 
<p>A Layout container is created using:</p>
<pre class="code">
Layout layout1 = new Layout(Adjustment hadjustment,
                           Adjustment vadjustment );
</pre>
As you can see, you can optionally specify the Adjustment objects
that the Layout widget will use for its scrolling. 
<p>You can add and move widgets in the Layout container using the
following two functions:</p>
<pre class="code">
layout1.Put(         Widget widget,
                     int       x,
                     int       y );

layout1.Move(        Widget widget,
                     int       x,
                     int       y );
</pre>
The size of the Layout container can be set using the next
function: 
<pre class="code">
Layout.Size = new Size(int      width, 
                       int      height );
</pre>
The final four functions for use with Layout widgets are for
manipulating the horizontal and vertical adjustment widgets: 
<pre class="code">
Adjustment layout1.Hadjustment();

Adjustment layout1.Vadjustment();

layout1.Hadjustment(Adjustment adjustment );

layout1.Vadjustment(Adjustment adjustment);


</pre>
