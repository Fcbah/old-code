Ruler widgets are used to indicate the location of
the mouse pointer in a given window. A window can have a vertical
ruler spanning across the width and a horizontal ruler spanning
down the height. A small triangular indicator on the ruler shows
the exact location of the pointer relative to the ruler.
<p>A ruler must first be created. Horizontal and vertical rulers
are created using</p>
<pre class="code">
HRuler hruler1 = new HRuler();    /* horizontal ruler */
VRuler vruler1 = new VRuler();    /* vertical ruler   */
</pre>Once a ruler is created, we can define the unit of
measurement. Units of measure for rulers can be Gtk.Pixels,
Gtk.Inches or Gtk.Centimeters. This is set using
<pre class="code">
hruler1.Metric = MetricType  metric;
</pre>The default measure is Gtk.Pixels.
<pre class="code">
hruler1.Metric = Gtk.Pixels;
</pre>Other important characteristics of a ruler are how to mark
the units of scale and where the position indicator is initially
placed. These are set for a ruler using
<pre class="code">
hruler.SetRange(          double   lower,
                          double   upper,
                          double   position,
                          double   max_size );
</pre>The lower and upper arguments define the extent of the ruler,
and max_size is the largest possible number that will be displayed.
Position defines the initial position of the pointer indicator
within the ruler.
<p>A vertical ruler can span an 800 pixel wide window thus</p>
<pre class="code">
hruler.SetRange(0, 800, 0, 800);
</pre>The markings displayed on the ruler will be from 0 to 800,
with a number for every 100 pixels. If instead we wanted the ruler
to range from 7 to 16, we would code
<pre class="code">
hruler.SetRange(7, 16, 0, 20);
</pre>The indicator on the ruler is a small triangular mark that
indicates the position of the pointer relative to the ruler. If the
ruler is used to follow the mouse pointer, the motion_notify_event
signal should be connected to the motion_notify_event method of the
ruler. To follow all mouse movements within a window area, we would
use
<pre class="code">
#define EVENT_METHOD(i, x) GTK_WIDGET_GET_CLASS(i)-&gt;x

    g_signal_connect_swapped (G_OBJECT (area),
"motion_notify_event",
           G_CALLBACK (EVENT_METHOD (ruler, motion_notify_event)),
           G_OBJECT (ruler));
</pre>The following example creates a drawing area with a
horizontal ruler above it and a vertical ruler to the left of it.
The size of the drawing area is 600 pixels wide by 400 pixels high.
The horizontal ruler spans from 7 to 13 with a mark every 100
pixels, while the vertical ruler spans from 0 to 400 with a mark
every 100 pixels. Placement of the drawing area and the rulers is
done using a table.
