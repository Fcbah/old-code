<p>[REMOVE THIS (?)]</p>
<p>You'll notice as you go on that GTK uses a type casting system.
This is always done using macros that both test the ability to cast
the given item, and perform the cast. Some common ones you will see
are:</p>
<pre class="code">
  G_OBJECT (object)
  GTK_WIDGET (widget)
  GTK_OBJECT (object)
  GTK_SIGNAL_FUNC (function)
  GTK_CONTAINER (container)
  GTK_WINDOW (window)
  GTK_BOX (box)
</pre>
These are all used to cast arguments in functions. You'll see them
in the examples, and can usually tell when to use them simply by
looking at the function's declaration. As you can see below in the
class hierarchy, all GtkWidgets are derived from the GObject base
class. This means you can use a widget in any place the function
asks for an object - simply use the G_OBJECT() macro. For example: 
<pre class="code">
g_signal_connect( G_OBJECT (button), "clicked",
                  G_CALLBACK (callback_function), callback_data);
</pre>
This casts the button into an object, and provides a cast for the
function pointer to the callback. Many widgets are also containers.
If you look in the class hierarchy below, you'll notice that many
widgets derive from the Container class. Any one of these widgets
may be used with the GTK_CONTAINER macro to pass them to functions
that ask for containers. Unfortunately, these macros are not
extensively covered in the tutorial, but I recommend taking a look
through the GTK header files or the GTK API reference manual. It
can be very educational. In fact, it's not difficult to learn how a
widget works just by looking at the function declarations.
