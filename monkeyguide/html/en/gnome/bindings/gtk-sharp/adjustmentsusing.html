<p>The adjustable widgets can be roughly divided into those which
use and require specific units for these values and those which
treat them as arbitrary numbers. The group which treats the values
as arbitrary numbers includes the range widgets (scrollbars and
scales, the progress bar widget, and the spin button widget). These
widgets are all the widgets which are typically "adjusted" directly
by the user with the mouse or keyboard. They will treat the lower
and upper values of an adjustment as a range within which the user
can manipulate the adjustment's value. By default, they will only
modify the value of an adjustment.</p>
<p>The other group includes the text widget, the viewport widget,
the compound list widget, and the scrolled window widget. All of
these widgets use pixel values for their adjustments. These are
also all widgets which are typically "adjusted" indirectly using
scrollbars. While all widgets which use adjustments can either
create their own adjustments or use ones you supply, you'll
generally want to let this particular category of widgets create
its own adjustments. Usually, they will eventually override all the
values except the value itself in whatever adjustments you give
them, but the results are, in general, undefined (meaning, you'll
have to read the source code to find out, and it may be different
from widget to widget).</p>
<p>Now, you're probably thinking, since text widgets and viewports
insist on setting everything except the value of their adjustments,
while scrollbars will only touch the adjustment's value, if you
share an adjustment object between a scrollbar and a text widget,
manipulating the scrollbar will automagically adjust the viewport
widget? Of course it will! Just like this:</p>
<pre class="code">
  /* creates its own adjustments */
  Viewport viewport = new Viewport(null, null);
  /* uses the newly-created adjustment for the scrollbar as well */
  VScrollbar vscrollbar = new VScrollbar(viewport.Adjustment);
</pre>
