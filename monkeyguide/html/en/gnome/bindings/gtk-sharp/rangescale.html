<p>Scale widgets are used to allow the user to visually select and
manipulate a value within a specific range. You might want to use a
scale widget, for example, to adjust the magnification level on a
zoomed preview of a picture, or to control the brightness of a
color, or to specify the number of minutes of inactivity before a
screensaver takes over the screen.</p>
<h3>Creating a Scale Widget</h3>
As with scrollbars, there are separate widget types for horizontal
and vertical scale widgets. (Most programmers seem to favour
horizontal scale widgets.) Since they work essentially the same
way, there's no need to treat them separately here. The following
functions create vertical and horizontal scale widgets,
respectively: 
<pre class="code">
VScale vscale1 = new VScale(Adjustment adjustment );

VScale vscale2 = new VScaleWithRange(double min,
                                     double max,
                                     double step );

HScale hscale1 = new HScale(Adjustment adjustment );

HScale hscale2 = new HScaleWithRange(double min,
                                     double max,
                                     double step );
</pre>
The adjustment argument can either be an adjustment object which
has already been created, or "null", in which case, an anonymous
Adjustment is created with all of its values set to 0.0 (which
isn't very useful in this case). In order to avoid confusing
yourself, you probably want to create your adjustment with a
page_size of 0.0 so that its upper value actually corresponds to
the highest value the user can select. The _new_with_range()
variants take care of creating a suitable adjustment. (If you're
already thoroughly confused, read the section on Adjustments again
for an explanation of what exactly adjustments do and how to create
and manipulate them.) 
<h3>Functions and Signals (well, functions, at least)</h3>
Scale widgets can display their current value as a number beside
the trough. The default behaviour is to show the value, but you can
change this with this function: 
<pre class="code">
vscale1.DrawValue = bool draw_value;
</pre>
As you might have guessed, draw_value is either "true" or "false",
with predictable consequences for either one. 
<p>The value displayed by a scale widget is rounded to one decimal
point by default, as is the value field in its Adjustment. You can
change this with:</p>
<pre class="code">
vscale1.Digits = int digits;
</pre>
where digits is the number of decimal places you want. You can set
digits to anything you like, but no more than 13 decimal places
will actually be drawn on screen. 
<p>Finally, the value can be drawn in different positions relative
to the trough:</p>
<pre class="code">
vscale1.ValuePos = PositionType  pos;
</pre>
The argument pos is of type GtkPositionType, which can take one of
the following values: 
<pre class="code">
  Gtk.Pos.Left
  Gtk.Pos.Right
  Gtk.Pos.Top
  Gtk.Pos.Bottom
</pre>
If you position the value on the "side" of the trough (e.g., on the
top or bottom of a horizontal scale widget), then it will follow
the slider up and down the trough. 
<p>All the preceding functions are defined in
&amp;li;gtk/gtkscale.h&gt;. The header files for all GTK widgets
are automatically included when you include
&amp;li;gtk/gtk.h&amp;li;. But you should look over the header
files of all widgets that interest you, in order to learn more
about their functions and features.</p>
