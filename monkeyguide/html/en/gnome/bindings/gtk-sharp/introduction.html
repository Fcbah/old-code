GTK (GIMP Toolkit) is a library for creating graphical user
interfaces. It is licensed using the LGPL license, so you can
develop open software, free software, or even commercial non-free
software using GTK without having to spend anything for licenses or
royalties. <br />
<br />
It's called the GIMP toolkit because it was originally written for
developing the GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP), but GTK has
now been used in a large number of software projects, including the
GNU Network Object Model Environment (GNOME) project. GTK is built
on top of GDK (GIMP Drawing Kit) which is basically a wrapper
around the low-level functions for accessing the underlying
windowing functions (Xlib in the case of the X windows system), and
gdk-pixbuf, a library for client-side image manipulation. 
<p>Gtk# is a binding for mono to this great toolkit, that is usable
from any Mono language including MonoBasic and C#.</p>
