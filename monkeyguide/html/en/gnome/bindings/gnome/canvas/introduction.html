The GNOME canvas is a high-level engine for creating structured
graphics. This means the programmer can insert graphical items like
lines, rectangles, and text into the canvas, and refer to them
later for further manipulation. The programmer does not need to
worry about repainting these items or generating events for them;
the canvas automatically takes care of these operations. 
<p>The canvas provides several predefined item types, including
lines, rectangles, and text. However, the canvas is designed to
serve as a general-purpose display engine. Applications can define
their own custom item types that integrate with the rest of the
canvas framework. This lets them have a flicker-free display engine
with proper event management and propagation.</p>
<p>The canvas supports two rendering models. One is based directly
on Xlib (used via GDK), which provides an extremely fast and lean
display that runs well over networks. The second rendering model is
based on Libart, a sophisticated library for manipulating and
rendering vector paths using antialiasing and alpha compositing.
Libart provides a superset of the PostScript imaging model,
allowing for extremely high-quality displays.</p>
<p>Simple applications can use the predefined canvas item types to
create interactive graphics displays. For example, the GNOME
Calendar program uses the canvas to display and manipulate monthly
calendars. It only needs simple graphical items like rectangles and
text to display its information. Please look at Figure 1 for an
example of the use of the canvas in the GNOME Calendar.</p>
<p>Applications with more sophisticated requirements can define
their custom canvas item types. The Gnumeric spreadsheet defines a
large &#8216;Sheet&#8217; item that takes care of painting the
sheet's grid and the cell contents. It also defines an item to
handle the complex cursor object in the spreadsheet, which must
handle the current selection, the current cell, and the border
items to drag and extend selections. Please look at Figure 2 for an
example of the use of the canvas in the Gnumeric spreadsheet.</p>
<p>This tutorial describes the architecture of the GNOME canvas and
Libart. It gives examples on why application writers may want to
use these technologies.</p>
