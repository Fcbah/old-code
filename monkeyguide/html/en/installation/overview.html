This covers the installation of mono on your platform, as well as
the installation and configuration of an IDE
<h2>Installation overview</h2>
<p>Mono is not finished - -it is a project still under development.
As a result, installation and configuration may not be as smooth as
you will be used to from other Linux applications. Nevertheless,
mono is in a state that will allow you to get it up and running and
gain experience with it - - which is, I would suggest, a very smart
thing to do.</p>
<p>This document is limited in the following sense: it describes
how to download a 'stable' version of mono as a 'tarball' and get
it to run on your computer. I'm also assuming you run mono on Linux
rather than on Windows. All the examples have been tested on a
'vanilla' Red Hat 7.3 installation.</p>
<p>This document will <i class="emphasis">not</i> cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How to self host the mcs compiler under linux.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<br />
<br />
<p>This document is also less useful for two types of people.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you are a very inexperienced linux user and want to know what
mono is all about, there is an easier way to install mono. Go to
mono.baselabs.org and download the rpm's ready for installation on
your system. This site also runs a tutorial that is worth
reading.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are a very experienced user wanting to contribute to the
mono code, you should probably regularly do a CVS download. At the
moment, the mono code grows very fast, and the 'stable' releases
still appear too slowly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This document is aimed at the mono beginner, and aims to present
a complete view of a minimal installation, which will allow you to
experiment with mono to some degree. It also describes some of
those experiments. We expect that after reading this document
you'll go on to do either of two things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>Continue to contribute to the mono project in some shape or
form. The website has some ideas and suggestions under the heading
'Contributing'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continue to write applications that run in mono.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We hope this document will be useful to you in your first steps
with mono. Happy hacking!</p>

<h2 class="sect2"><a name="note" id="note">A note on the
development of this document</a></h2>
<p>This document is expected to grow into a full 'running mono
howto' over time. As of yet, it does not really discuss some of the
excellent efforts of others to package mono into an rpm or deb and
prepare it for easy installation. It is our aim to include this in
future versions of this document.</p>
