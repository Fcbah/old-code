  <h2>GUI Compatibility</h2>

<p>
  The default GUI toolkit for .NET on Windows is called
  System.Windows.Forms.  "Winforms," as it is sometimes called, is a
  Windows32-based API that produces applications with native Windows
  look and feel. Mono 1.2 plans to offer full support for
  System.Windows.Forms, but the current implementation is incomplete
  and unstable.
 </p>
 
 <p>
   A good alternative is Gtk#, which is as good on Windows as it is on
   Linux. Gtk# is a .NET wrapper to the toolkit used for GNOME
   applications and the award-winning GIMP image editor.  Gtk has two
   features that make it particularly appealing: first, it can be
   themed to match native applications on any given platform. Second,
   window layout is relative and therefore scales naturally as buttons
   or windows expand-- particularly important for internationalization
   and accessibility to the visually impaired. 
</p>

<h2>Gtk# Platform Compatibility</h2>

<p>
  Nearly every GNOME library is accessible through Mono.  The following
  Gtk# libraries are known to work on both Windows and Linux:
</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Gtk: The base set of buttons, selectors, and other assorted widgets.</li>
    <li>Gdk - The drawing tool set. </li>
    <li>Pango - Internationalization-friendly text rendering, with full UTF-8 support.</li>
    <li>Atk - Accessibility toolkit for people with vision or mobility impairments.</li>
    <li>LibGlade - Allows user interface to be designed in XML.</li>
    <li>Glade Interface Builder - Graphical application for user interface design.</li>
  </ul>

      <p>
        Other portions of Gtk# are less likely to work on
        Windows.  For more information, read the chapter on <a
        href="../gnome/introduction.html">Gtk#</a>.
