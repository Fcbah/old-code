<h1>Ensuring Cross-Platform Compatibility</h1>

<p>
  If you build your application with cross-platform execution in mind,
  it will be more likely to succeed. Even if your development tools
  are neutral, you need to make sure that you are aware of the
  differences and similarities among the various target platforms.
</p>

<p>Here are several rules you can follow to build cross-platform applications:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Use relative paths when naming files. The file C:\Program
  Files\yourapplication does not exist on Linux, and /usr/lib/ isn't
  available under Windows.</li>

  <li>In the same vein, try to avoid platform-specific resources like
  the Windows registry (Microsft.Win32.Registry).</li>
  
  <li>Given the choice between Gtk# and System.Windows.Forms, use
  Gtk#. Gtk# for Windows is better than System.Windows.Forms for
  Linux.</li>
  
  <li>Only use Platform Invoke (P/Invoke) if you really need it. If
  possible, use a library that is available on UNIX and Windows.</li>

  <li>
    If you do use P/Invoke or another platform-specific resource,
    don't just assume it exists. Instead, check for it and provide a
    clear error message if it fails. 
  </li>
</ul>
