<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
  Although it's possible to compile C or C++ code on more than one
  platform, it's far from easy, especially when those platforms vary
  as much as Windows and Linux do. That's why truly cross-platform
  tools like Mono are so important: they make it easy for developers
  to build cross-platform binaries that work without recompilation.
  For example, the MCS compiler works on Windows, Linux, Solaris, and
  Mac OS X.  
</p>


<p> 
  Sometimes, application developers use the Platform Invoke, or
  P/Invoke, method to access platform-specific native libraries on Linux
  or Windows.  If you are not concerned about cross-platform operation,
  or if you need to use OS-specific libraries, you have access to the
  underlying platform at an intimate level through P/Invoke.
