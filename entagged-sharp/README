DEPRECATED!
Please use 'taglib-sharp' for new code, located in mono subversion
-----------------


entagged-sharp is a metadata library written in pure C#. It has no dependencies
other than the base .NET/C# system.

entagged-sharp is a port of the Java code. Its API is for the most part
identical to that of the Java code. See http://entagged.sf.net/ for the 
lower level API documentation.

HOWEVER, an API wrapper has been written to simplify the use of entagged, 
and it is recommended that your C#/.NET application use the AudioFileWrapper
class instead of the AudioFile/AudioFileIO classes directly:

AudioFileWrapper af = new AudioFileWrapper("mysong.mp3");
Console.WriteLine(af.Artist + " - " + af.Title);

See the src/AudioFileWrapper.cs file for API information. Documentation
will be produced later.
