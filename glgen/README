This is (yet another) OpenGL binding to C#.  This one follows the work of the 
GTK# project.  We use the C header files to create a little C# library that
P/Invokes the system GL library.

This library contains bindings to GL and glut.  An example app is in gears.cs.

This isn't fancy at all, but it works for me.  Should also work for any madman
who wants to port Quake2 to C#.

Contact crichton@gimp.org for more info.

Generator shamelessly ripped off from Gtk#, so it's under the GPL.

gl.cs and glut.cs are LGPLed.  glut.cs is by Mark Steele.
