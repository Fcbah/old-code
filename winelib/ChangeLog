	* configure.ac (AC_OUTPUT): Remove dotnetctl/Makefile from here
	as well. configure wouldn't run with the resulting tarball
	wouldn't run otherwise.

   * Makefile.in: Commented out dotnetctl subdir until I have time to deal with
   the new wine switches for newer wine versions

2004-03-16 Peter Bartok <pbartok@novell.com>
   * configure.ac: Fixed AC_INIT arguments
   * Makefile.in: Added 'dist' and 'distcheck' rules (distcheck still needs work)

   * configure.ac: Removed wine_uuid check
   * Make.rule.in: Removed wine_uuid reference
