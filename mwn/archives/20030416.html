<h3>1.1 How to use Windows.Forms in Linux</h3>
		
		<p>
		    Alexandre has provided a modified version of the GC system that
		    will work with and Mono. See the <a
		    href="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-winforms-list">mono-winforms-list</a>.
		    It is now possible to run our Win32-based implementation of Windows.Forms
		    with Mono on Linux. Looking for a screenshot, <a
		    href="http://go-mono.com/images/WINESWF.JPG">sure</a>. And then
		    you will likely want to enable this in your Linux box. <a
		    href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-winforms-list/2003-March/000165.html">Here</a>
		    is the recipe.
		</p>



<h3>1.2 Second Mono Survey</h3>
		
		<p>
			There is a new Mono survey for all the people who are
			interested in developing with this free .NET Framework 
			implemententation. If your company is involved with the 
			development and deployment of web applications, if 
			Linux is becoming an important part of your company's 
			business application strategy, if you are considering 
			Mono for your next project or if you would you like to 
			shape the future of Mono and the use of Linux in business 
			critical applications you should consider contacting
			<a 
			href="mailto:mbadgett@ximian.com">mbadgett@ximian.com</a>
			to learn what Mono can do for you.
		</p>



<h3>1.3 Miguel tells it all at OSNEWs</h3>
		
		<p>
			Miguel was <a 
			href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=3170">interviewed</a> 
			at OSNEWs about Mono and other projects as <a 
			href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/gnumeric/index.shtml">Gnumeric</a>.
			A must read to those who are interested in the evolution of the
			Mono.    
		</p>



<h3>1.4 New Mono community site</h3>
		
		<p>
			A friend of Jackson has opened a Mono
			community
			site called 
			<a
			href="http://www.gotmono.com">Got Mono!</a>. A 
			bunch of the monoers already have their accounts
			there and are filling the forums discussing 
			about Monkey Business... Come in and join.
		</p>



<h3>1.5 GtkMozEmbed, SWT and Gtk#-based NUnit tool</h3>
		
		<p>
			Mark has checked his bindings for Gtk-based Mozilla into CVS, 
			module name: `GtkMozEmbed'. Read the <a 
			href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2003-April/013247.html">details</a>.
			The SWT port to C# using Gtk is <a 
			href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/sd-mono-port/2003-March/000114.html">progressing</a>. Screenshots are <a 
			href="http://www.roboto.ch/swt">here</a>. 
			Gonzalo has checked in his <a
			href="http://gtk-sharp.sf.net">Gtk#</a>-based <a 
			href="http://nunit.org">NUnit</a> tool. Screenshots 
			are <a
			href="http://primates.ximian.com/~gonzalo/mono/shots/running.png">here</a>      and <a
			href="http://primates.ximian.com/~gonzalo/mono/shots/finished.png">here</a>
		</p>



<h3>1.6 New compilation engine</h3>
		
		<p>
			The new Mono compilation engine (yes!, mini!) has been placed on 
			CVS. Miguel explained how to compile it (it's out of the main 
			build) and use it <a
			href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2003-April/013269.html">here</a>. Zoltan has commited his <a 
			href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-devel-list/2003-April/000274.html">typed allocation</a> patches to CVS as well.
		</p>
		 



<h3>1.7 First Mono Book is out; Team pages</h3>
		
		<p>
			The first book to cover Mono is out. This book is 
			currently only available in German, you can find it <a
			href="http://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/3827264928/qid=1050051051/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_3_1/028-2755135-1623712">here</a>
			We now have a page for the <a 
			href="http://www.go-mono.com/team.html">Mono Team</a> 
			where we include a list of some of the people who have 
			made Mono possible. If you have CVS access, please 
			update the page to include your information.
		</p>

<h3>2. Meet the team. This week Gonzalo Paniagua Javier</h3>

<p>
       The Mono team is integrated by contributors all around the
       world that are working really hard to get this project going
       further. In this section we will be meeting this people so
       we can know more about them and what they are doing.
</p>

<p>Gonzalo is a 27 years old Ximian hacker (his birthday, Feb 29th)
   who was born in Plasencia, Spain, currently living in Playa de
   San Juan.
   In the past five years he has been working as a programmer for
   several computer companies building code with COBOL, Visual C++,
   Turbo C++, PHP, Java, C interacting with Oracle, DB2, CICS, etc.
</p>
<p>
   He is also coordinator of the <a
   href="http://www.rfc-es.org">RFC spanish translation effort</a>
   as well as a <a href="http://www.gnome-db.org">GNOME-DB</a>
   contributor and one of the core dudes of the spanish free
   software community. In his spare time he likes programming
   (non-stop!) and his favourite language is C, which he enjoys
   writing with gvim. Though he doesn't like taking part in
   'religious' wars about anything.
</p>

<h4>Interview with Gonzalo</h4>

<p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span>
Have you been involved in another free software projects before
joining the mono team?
</p>

<p class="answer"><span class="person">Gonzalo Paniagua:</span>
Yeah. A friend of mine (note of the editor: Gonzalo is referencing
Carlos Perelló, one of the most appreciated free software hackers in
Spain), convinced me to collaborate in the gnome-db effort and I
joined them when the GNOME 2 port was getting shape. I used (and use)
to spend my spare time programming my own stuff. This gave me the
opportunity to join other people's efforts and collaborate in an
interesting project. And I liked working that way.
</p>

<p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span>
So then you went to work for Ximian and you become the System.Web
man...
</p>

<p class="answer"><span class="person">Gonzalo Paniagua:</span>
Not that fast. First I was coding here and there (small fixes and
such). Then integerformatter and then ASP.NET came into play.
</p>

<p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span>
Since you started with a inmature Mono you had to do a lot of
work to get the basis for System.Web. Am I right?.
</p>

<p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span>
No, in fact, many things in System.Web were in place thanks
to the work by Gaurav, Leen and Patrik. Duncan made the
stuff compile. And then I took all of that and started my
work adding the code generator, some glue and bug fixing.
There was also some missing parts in other namespaces such
as System.Configuration that we manage to implement in
order to make System.Web work.
</p>

<p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span> And you
wrote the core System.Configuration and related classes...?
</p>

<p class="answer"><span class="person">Gonzalo Paniagua</span>
Yeah. There was some work by Duncan and Christopher Podurgiel. I
added the rest.</p>

<p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span>And what about
ASP.NET, did you enjoy building it?</p>

<p class="answer"><span class="person">Gonzalo Paniagua:</span>
Yes!! It was hard to begin with the code generator but then
one day the first page was rendered... And no one can stop us
now ;-)..</p>

<p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span>
As an expert in ASP.NET and .NET Web based technologies, what can
you say about the desing?. Is ASP.NET as powerful as it promises?</p>

<p class="answer"><span class="person">Gonzalo Paniagua:</span>
Well, I don't consider myself an expert on anything.  But I have
to say that I didn't like web related stuff until I discovered
ASP.NET. I like programming a web page as if I am programming a
desktop application: events, components. And that's really cool.
</p>

<p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span>
Do you think ASP.NET will be replacing JSP?</p>

<p class="answer"><span class="person">Gonzalo Paniagua:</span>
I think so. And also MS does. It offers equivalent functionality
+ integration with all that .NET brings to us. But the transition
will be slow. There is too much money invested in that and people
will not change things to see what happens. They are not geeks
that change their systems from one day to another. They care about
money (TCO, as they call it). I hope mono helps them on this...
</p>

<p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span>
Apart of having the possibility of choosing any of the .NET
languages, what are the other main benefits you encounter in
ASP.NET that would make people use it instead of JSP?</p>

<p class="answer"><span class="person">Gonzalo Paniagua:</span>
Easy deploying, separation between HTML and code, highly
configurable + all the services that .NET offers: security
(isolation of applications), database access, distributed
computing (remoting, web services).</p>

<p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span>
What about your pet called 'XSP'? what can you tell us about
the very first free ASP.NET server?</p>

<p class="question"><span class="person">Gonzalo Paniagua:</span>
In the beginning that module contained only the code
generator stuff (ASP.NET pages - C# code - assembly - load -
execute). ie, the conversion from aspx to C# then i added
some hacks (not compatible with MS) to make it serve the first
mono ASP.NET page. Later on, I implemented the current server
and made it work under MS runtime, then made mono work with
that and remove those imcompatible hacks. The current server
runs in both mono and MS rutime.</p>

<p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span>
Do you expect to see many C# web controls around?. Any plans
in Mono about them?.</p>

<p class="answer"><span class="person">Gonzalo Paniagua:</span>
Yes, I do. There are already vendors that provide some nice
web controls such as treeviews. Also there are quite a few sites
devoted to ASP.NET offering code samples and useful web
controls. In XSP module we have a couple of control samples in
the xsp module. Apart from that, there are no plans of creating
more controls in Mono (yet). We welcome anyone to add more web
controls to the xsp tests.</p>

<p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span>
How is the mod_mono status, now?.</p>

<p class="answer"><span class="person">Gonzalo Paniagua</span>
The last time I tried (and no modificationes since then), it
worked fine. I noticed that it's slower than xsp server, but
that may be due to apache unloading the module (as yoros
pointed out). Thus making the server compile the pages on
every request as the cache is lost. Btw, I'm not the maintainer
of that module. Daniel Lopez is tha man.</p>

<p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span>
What is Mono going to use mainly?. Will you recommend xsp or
apache + mod_mono?
</p>

<p class="answer"><span class="person">Gonzalo Paniagua:</span>
XSP is just a test toy. So there's only another option by now ;-).
The remoting work by Lluis, Patrik and the runtime guys was an
important milestone for ASP.NET to get in shape.</p>
</p>



<h3>3. Mailing lists activity</h3>

<p>	
	As the MWN were stopped for more than a week. I will

<p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Duncan sent a very nice <a
	  href="http://www.zope.org/Members/Brian/PythonNet/index_html">link</a>	  for all of you that like coding Python. You will find information
	  about how to do use the power of the CLI while scripting Python.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	  Dennis Hayes, one of the Mono contributors, is now writing
	  for the ".NET developers journal". Let's show what he sent 
	  to the list: "<i>Starting with the April issue, I will be 
	  writing a monthly column in the ".NET Developers Journal". 
	  The name of the column is "Monkey Business", and it will 
	  be news about developments in open source implantations of 
	  .NET, Rotor, Mono, and Gnu.NET. You can read a blurb about 
	  a March article on Mono, "What the Monkey Can Do", and see 
	  the cover at http://www.sys-con.com/dotnet, but you have to
	  subscribe before you can read the article or column. May's 
	  column is done, but if there is anything you want to appear
