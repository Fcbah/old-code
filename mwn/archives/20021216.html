<p>  <h3>1.1 Mono Commercial uses.</h3>
<p>  <a href="http://www.tipic.com">Tipic</a> today <a href="http://www.ximian.com/about_us/press_center/press_releases/index.html?pr=tipic_mono">announced</a> 
     their work on porting their Instant Messaging Server platform to run on 
     Mono. <a href="http://www.winfessor.com">Winfessor</a> also 
     <a href="http://www.winfessor.com/press.asp">announced</a> the 
     availability of their Jabber SDK to run on Mono.eAlso two weeks ago we 
     mentioned <a href="http://www.openlinksw.com">OpenLink Software's</a> <a href="http://www.ximian.com/about_us/press_center/press_releases/index.html?pr=openlink_mono">announcement</a> of their product, also using Mono. 
</p>

<p>  <h3>1.2 Mono's ASP.NET does 1% of the market in one week!</h3></p>

<p>  <a href="http://www.netcraft.com">Netcraft</a> has published this 
     <a href="http://www.netcraft.com/survey/">survey</a> where you can read the
     following statement: "around 1% of internet sites using ASP.Net are Linux 
     based, but it is early days both for the Mono project and for .Net itself, 
     and both will be hoping to grow very significantly from current levels." 
     If you want to read more on this, follow this 
     <a href="http://www.netcraft.com/survey/">link</a>.
</p>

<p>  <h3>1.3 More changes to MonoBasic.</h3></p>

<p>  Marco has been working a lot in the MonoBasic implementation and now the 
     Try/Catch/Finally statements work, statically declared events work,
     For/Next/Step also work and properties work too!.

<p>  <h3>1.4 Transactions available in System.Data with Xml.</h3></p>

<p>  Ville has done some coding on XmlDataDocument. XmlDataDocument is 
     the class which "communicates" with DataSet, so these "transactions" 
     means updating, deleting, and adding DataRows and Datacolumns to DataSet.
</p>

<p> <h3>1.5 Multiple threads support in the debugger.</h3></p>
	
<p>  The debugger is now getting multi-thread debugging support. Details: 
     a global thread lock mechanism has been added, a new command line 
     interface is there for everybody to use. Getting registers is working 
     again. The ScriptingContext now supports a synchronous (for the 
     command-line interpreter) and an asynchronous (for the gui) interface. 
     BackTraceView is working. The handling of synchronous commands was 
     improved. 
</p>

<p> <h3>1.6 Reflection.Emit can be used in Run mode.</h3></p>

<p>
    Zoltan Varga has contributed the support for running code generated by 
    Reflection.Emit. This means Reflection.Emit now support 'Run' mode and not
    only 'Save' mode as before. This allows us to generate code on the fly
    and hand it over to the JIT. Now we will be able to JIT compiler our 
    regular expression patterns like MS implementation does.
</p>

<p> <h3>1.7 More work in NUnit 2 integration.</h3></p>

<p> A lot of test suites were added, as the ones for Publisher and 
    PublisherMembershipCondition, for DataSet, Xml-tests, for StrongName,
    and StrongNamePublicKeyBlob.
</p>

<p> <h3>1.8 Lots of improvements in ASP.NET.</h3></p>

<p> Gonzalo has revised the C# generator that is much efficient than before,
    the user controls' automatic events are activated now properly. His work
    has made possible to load .ascx controls per program, to get datalist
    fixed and now all the test are working, the @Page, @Application and
    @Control are now available and he has started the authentification 
    support using Forms. He has also fixed a coupple of validators and 
    got the kernel32.dll not found warning out!.
</p> 

<p> <h3>1.9 Mono Annual Report.</h3></p>

<p> No doubt, this has been the year where Mono has proved to be a serious
    project that is accomplishing the heraldic task of building an
    opensource implementation of .NET that will be available for everybody.
    After twelve months of development it's time to look back and see the
    what we have been doing. 
    <a href="http://monoevo.sourceforge.net/mono/annualreport.txt">Here</a>
    you can find a little resume with some OpenCalc 
    <a href="http://monoevo.sourceforge.net/mono/annualreport.sxc">charts</a>.
</p>

<p> <h3>1.10 Platano's out and GNOME# for Debian too!.</h3></p>
<p> Alp Toker has released <a href="http://www.atoker.com/platano/">Platano</a>, 
    the very first Mono based media player. He has also packaged GNOME# 
    capable packages, the deb urls are these: 
</p>

<p> <ul>
      <li>deb http://www.debianplanet.org/mono unstable main</li>
      <li>deb-src http://www.debianplanet.org/mono unstable main</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p> <h3>1.11 Miguel and Mono in Business2.com.</h3></p>

<p> Business2.com has published a very nice article about Miguel and Mono,
    you can read it 
    <a href="https://www.business2.com/articles/mag/0,1640,45454,FF.html">here</a>.
    If you get the magazine in print you can see a penguin and Miguel wearing a 
    suit!.
</p>

<p> <h3>1.12 Miguel for the Renegade Awards.</h3></p>

<p> Miguel is one of the five people on the list of people on Wired Magazine's 
    "Wired Rave Awards", for the 'Renegade of Year' award. So now you can vote
    for him <a href="http://www.raveawards.com">here</a> if you live inside the
    USA. If you don't... well, try to work out something.
</p>
    
<p> <h3>2. Meet the team. This week Sebastien Pouliot.</h3></p>
    The Mono team is integrated by contributors all over the world that are
    working really hard to get this project going further. In this section
    we will be meeting this people so we can know more about them and what
    they are doing. 
</p>

<p>
    This week we have been talking to Sebastien Pouliot in the IRC. Sebastien
    is the developer who has worked out most of the Cryptography classes in 
    Mono. Let's see what he told us (before the kids came back!).
</p>

<h4>Interview with Sebastien Pouliot</h4>
<table border=1 width="100%">
<tr><td>
<p><b>MWN: So, Sebastien, would you like to explain to the Mono Community which 
are your interests in Mono?</b>
</p>

<p><b>S.Pouliot:</b> I've been following mono evolution for the last year, well 
soon after I started programming in C#, as I was looking for people using the 
crypto classes.
</p>

<p><b>MWN: And why did you took the System.Crypto namespace classes?. Are you 
a security developer?</b>
</p>

<p><b>S.Pouliot:</b> My work involves security. However we don't often get the 
chance to code low-level stuff - like encryption algorithms. Those are almost 
always available before stating a project. I'm a security architect. I design 
security solution for products and some consulting for Motus Technologies 
(http://www.motus.com).
</p>

<p><b>MWN: Since you are the Cryptography expert in the Mono Team, what can you 
say about the security design in .NET and the implementation Mono is doing?.</b>
</p>

<p><b>S.Pouliot:</b> The .NET design (both CLR and the class library) is a big 
step toward a better security architecture. Just using managed code should solve 
many of the current security issues (like stack overrun). Mono is currently 
building features into it's class library. Eventually we'll have to ensure that 
every access to ressource is correctly protected. This will take some time but, 
being open-source, I'm sure mono will get (at least) as secure as the Microsoft 
implementation.
</p>

<p><b>MWN: You have been in touch with a lot of the software in the Mono source 
tree, which of the classes you have contributed to are the ones you believe are
more useful for the other developers?.</b>
</p>

<p><b>S.Pouliot:</b> This is difficult to answer. Most people won't use any of 
the security classes directly. X509 certificates and RSA are the classes that 
may get used without the knowledge of the developpers like in code signing, 
permissions... the base are already there but more work is needed before we see 
them in action. Hopefully more and more developers will start using 
higher-level classes, i.e. outside Cryptography. It's so much easier to upgrade 
a SOAP web service to use WS-Security than to build your own secure 
communication. I'm just starting to look where are the crypto classes being 
used in the framework. So far I've compiled a small list inside corlib. I 
expect to find much more of them in other assembly. The hard part is getting 
people with different expertises to work at a single issue the same time - 
instead of iteratively. And this will be needed to complete the most complex 
classes (like Xml Signature which mix XML and digital signature).
</p>

<p><b>MWN: Anything you'd like to say to the world?</b></p>

<p><b>S.Pouliot:</b> One last thing. I was very lucky with people and I reused 
their own sources into Mono (like Sergey's MiniParser, BouncyCastle's 
asymmetric key generation, Chew Keong TAN's BigInteger class). Much of my 
work wouldn't be apparent without all those donations. Many thanks to them!

<p> <h3>5. Mailing List Activity.</h3></p>

<p> Most of the mails were related to errors when installing and/or running the 
    new release of Mono. Finally new packages were released and all those problems
    disappeared.
</p>

<p> There was some discussion about why is Nant being used instead of make, the
    answer is simple: "Sean thought it was better than make and volunteered to 
    do the work".
</p>

<p> People have noticed that Mono is being monitored by lots of media. And they 
    have sent emails reflecting this. Here are some interesting links:
    <a href="http://www.wininformant.com/Articles/Index.cfm?ArticleID=27580">Wininformant</a>,
    <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1001-977080.html">News.Com</a> and 
    <a href="http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1104-977080.html">Zdnet</a>.
</p>

<p> The C++ and CLR thread was also quite interesting. Someone was asking if CIL and Mono
    support the multiple inheritance and related questions. The fact is the CIL doesn't
    need to be modified, multiple-inheritance is supported by C++ and Eiffel using 
    different mechanisms. The Mono team position is clear, remaining
    compatibility with Microsoft CIL is more important than extending issues so people
    are invited to do their reseach using the Mono platform and then submitting the 
    propose to ECMA for standarization, but that is not going to be done from Mono (at
    least in a long time).
