<h3>1.1 Mono Project wins best Open Source Project</h3>

 Reading from <a href="http://www.gnomedesktop.org">GnomeDesktop</a>:
 "Some news from the trenches: Mono has just won the title of Best
 Open Source Project at LinuxWorld Expo following nomination for the
 category last week. With almost 800,000 lines of code and over 100
 developers, Mono has come a long way in the two years since its
 announcement. Here's three cheers for the Mono developers!". You can
 find more information at <a
 href="http://www.ximian.com">Ximian</a>, in this <a
 href="http://www.ximian.com/about_us/press_center/press_releases/index.html?pr=lwe_2004_awards">page</a>.
 Another
 description is <a
 href="http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2003-01-23-024-26-OP-EV">here</a>.
 Go on Mono Hackers! 

<h3>1.2 Virtuoso 3.0 ships with Mono</h3>

 OpenLink's Virtuoso is the first commercial product shipping that
 uses Mono as you can read in this interesting <a
 href="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/030123/neth013_1.html">press
 release</a>. This is a big step forward to prove that, even in
 a development state, Mono's Framework can already be used to build
 very competitive applications enabled to run under Windows, Linux
 and UNIX (and probably MacOS X too!).

<h3>1.3 Screenshots page</h3>

 We have opened a new section in the <a
 href="http://www.go-mono.org">project</a> website with some
 screenshots of applications that use Mono, Gtk# and GNOME#.
 You can find it <a
 href="http://www.go-mono.org/screenshots.html">here</a>

<h3>1.4 Mono on MSNBC</h3>

 You can read about the fabulous article called <a
 href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/864039.asp">Breaking down the .Net
 barriers</a> at Microsoft's <a href="http://www.msnbc.com">MSNBC</a>.

<h3>1.5 Beginnings of Alpha trampoline</h3>

 Laramie Leavitt has <a
 href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2003-January/011578.html">announced</a>
 the beginning of an Alpha trampoline for Mono. He also stated "My
 goal is to get mono to run on my Alpha running Linux".  To the 
 question: "Are you planning on this port for OpenVMS or UNIX?".
 Laramie asked: "Be my guest to do the VMS port... I assume that we 
 will be able to use a lot of the same infrastructure." 
 
<h3>1.6 Mbas improvements</h3>

 Marco Ridoni has added attributes support to mBas (beside other
 fixes). Rafael D. Teixeira has also completed the list of command
 line options that you can view with <i>'mbas --help'</i> 

<h3>2. Meet the team. This week Lluis Sanchez</h3>

	<p>The Mono team is integrated by contributors all over the world
	that are working really hard to get this project going
	further. In this section we will be meeting this people so we
	can know more about them and what they are doing.</p>
	
	<p>This week we are proud to present <b>Lluis Sanchez</b>.  Lluis
	is a software engineer from Igualada that now resides in
	Barcelona, Catalunya (Spain). He has been working for seven
	years for a company located in Spain as a consultant for
	projects mainly bases on Microsoft technologies although
	during the last years he has been using a lot of Java. One
	month ago he decided to finish his consultant career
	("forever, I hope", Lluis says) and he is currently
	unemployed. "And that's why I've so much time to work in mono
	;-)" he explains.</p>

	<p>We must say that as for Enomoto, this is the
	first open source community project he contributes to, which
	has introduced him to the Linux world too, since he started to
	play with it two months ago in order to develop with and for
	Mono.  During his free time he enjoys what he calls
	'traditional hobbies' as watching movies and reading a lot
	(specially SF) as well as traveling and taking photos with his
	digital camera.</p>

    
<h4>Interview with Lluis Sanchez</h4>

This week we had a chance to meet Lluis at #mono, let's see what he
told us.

	<p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span> So Lluis,
	why are you interested in a project like Mono?. Can you
	explain us why did you decided to contribute to this open
	source project?.</p>
	
	<p class="answer"><span class="person">Lluis Sanchez:</span>
	Well. I've very interested in Mono as a server platform. I
	think it may be key to the success of Mono. In the last two
	years I've seen a tendency in small and medium companies to
	introduce Linux as a server. So I find very interesting to
	help on this evolution of mono and Linux.</p>
	
	<p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span> And why
	did you choose to start with Remoting?.</p>
	
	<p class="answer"><span class="person">luis Sanchez:</span>
	Remoting is the key for using mono as a server platform And
	the base for a mono based application server. I'm very
	interested in developing or helping to develop an application
	server based on .NET that could run on Linux and working in
	the development of remoting is allowing me to learn a lot of
	things that would be needed in such a project. I also like
	very much distributed computing :-)</p>
	
	<p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span> What are
	the main benefits you encounter in .NET Remoting that you
	think are so important for a distributed environment?</p>
	
	
	<p class="answer"><span class="person">Lluis Sanchez:</span>
	Well, Remoting makes very easy the development of distributed
	applications. For windows developers, comparing to DCOM, it is
	much easier to use, to configure, to deploy... it gives much
	more flexibility comparing to Java RMI, I think the main
	benefit is flexibility. The same remoting framework can be
	used for any kind of communication, using any format. The big
	advantage of remoting is that you can build your own channels
	and formatters and then you can interact using any of the
	protocols you implemented, as you could do with
	CORBA. Remoting also benefits from other nice features of .NET
	like assembly versioning, serialization, ...</p>
	
	
	<p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span> Do you
	think that we can see 'the Mono' as the missing link between
	the Microsoft world and the UN*X world when talking about
	cross-platform application development?</p>
	
	<p class="answer">(Lluis laughs)</p>
	
	<p class="answer"><span class="person">Lluis Sanchez:</span>
	yes indeed for windows developers it will be very easy to
	start developing programs for UN*X now. Companies that
	traditionally develop its programs for MS technologies, will
	find that with a little more effort they can deploy also their
	applications in UN*X. This may change their point of view when
	planning projects and it is not only about portability for
	example a software developer or software architect that only
	knows MS technologies, will only consider using MS as a server
	platform now, he/she can also consider using Linux and Mono as
	a server platform.  With the same skills (almost). Then,
	he/she is not using mono because it is portable, but because
	it can run on Linux, which is cheap.</p>
	
	
	<p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span> During
	your investigations on Remoting, have you seen anything in the
	design that could be improved or that you think you could
	advice of?</p>
	
	<p class="answer"><span class="person">Lluis Sanchez:</span>
	It's difficult to say. Remoting has a complex
	design. Sometimes I see some design decisions that I don't
	fully understand or for which I think that there is a better
	solutions, but in general I like it.</p>
	
	
	<p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span> Which are
	those strange design decisions you mention?, can you remember
	them?</p>
	
	
	<p class="answer"><span class="person">Lluis Sanchez:</span>
	Just details. Sometimes I see methods that are public and
	maybe should not, or some methods that seem to do the same in
	different classes... Well, one area of improvement would be
	how information is serialized. The binary format used by
	BinaryFormatter could produce a more compact serialization
	than it does now.</p>
	
	
	<p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span> After
	remoting is finished what would you like to do?, maybe
	contribute to a CORBA implementation for Mono or porting
	existing ones as harmless or OpenORB?</p>
	
	<p class="answer"><span class="person">Lluis Sanchez:</span>
	There is still a lot of work to do in Remoting :-). I would
	enjoy contributing to a CORBA implementation although it is
	not one of my priorities. After remoting, I think that I will
	focus on EnterpriseServices. But it is hard to say... </p>
	
	
	<p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span> Is there
	anything you would like to say to the community before we
	go?.</p>
	
	<p class="answer"><span class="person">Lluis Sanchez:</span>
	Yes. I'm very proud to be able to participate in this
	project. I'll like to thank all people that is making it a
	reality. And for any question about remoting, here I
	am. :-)</p>
	
	<p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span> Thanks
	for your time, Lluis.</p>

<h3>3. Mailing List Activity</h3>

  This week the lists were stopped for some days due to maintenance.
  That was reflected in seeing little movement in the lists. 
  
   The main points:
   <ul>
   <li>Some of us, we have been shown that the parser never sees
   comments and then you can put comments wherever you want that
   the compiler will not complain.</li>
   <li>Rafael wrote an <a href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2003-January/011587.html">interesting</a> email for those that want to
   know how to run C# applets.</li>
   <li>Paolo told us how to contribute to the ilasm tool. <a
   href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2003-January/011647.html">Here</a>
   is how.</li>
   <li>Lluis has written the a <a
   href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2003-January/011653.html">description</a>
   about the current status of the Remoting implementation.</li>
   <li>Jonathan Pryor told us what <a href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2003-January/011676.html">Dwarf</a> is.</li>
   <li>Derek Ferguson pointed <a
