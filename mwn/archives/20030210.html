<h3>1.1 Jabber/XMPP library for IM</h3>

We are pleased to announce the first official release of our SoapBox
Framework for Mono.  The SoapBox Framework is a Jabber/XMPP library for
instant messaging and collaboration that focuses on ease of use and a
clearly defined object model.  The Framework also comes with enhanced
XML based trace support and excellent documentation, including a
detailed User's Guide, and unparalleled customer support. Get more
info at <a href="http://www.winfessor.com">winfessor</a>.


<h3>1.2 SharpDevelop 0.94 is now released</h3>

SharpDevelop 0.94 is now released. You can read about the changes under:
<a href="http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/Forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=1403">http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/Forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=1403</a>.
An nother point is, that there existing now a Mailinglist for porting 
SharpDevelop to Mono. You can reach this list under
<a href="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/sd-mono-port">sd-mono-port</a>.

<h3>1.3 The PostgreSQL Native Net Provider for Mono Npsql</h3>

Dave Page added this news about Npgsql on Mono Class Library cvs at
www.postgresql.com news. You can see his post at <a href="http://www.postgresql.com/news.php?NewsID=124">http://www.postgresql.com/news.php?NewsID=124</a>.


<h3>1.4 Monodoc 0.1 out!</h3>

A preliminary release of the Mono Documentation Browser is now
availble. You can read the <a
href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2003-February/011935.html">release
notes</a>. Go and <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/monodoc-0.1.tar.gz">test it!</a>

<h3>1.5 Remoting: Communication between AppDomains</h3>

Now Patrick and Lluis are working in new remoting improvements like the
communication between AppDomains. With this and all the work that is
making soon we'll can communicate with AppDomains and activate objects
remotelly with the implementation of singletons and singlecalls that is
working currently Lluis Valles.

<h3>1.6 Lots of improvements in the Visual Basic.NET implementation</h3>

Marco Ridoni and Daniel Campos have done a lot of work in the VB.NET
implementation. The list of things that work now is really big:
type declaration, classes and modules can be declared, classes can
inherit from other classes or interfaces, attributes, structures,
operators, namespaces, local variables, try/catch and exceptions,
methods, properties, events, fields, they all work. Methods support
ByRef and Optional parameters, properties support parameters,
accessors, etc. Constructors work and are correctly called. And the
AddHandler as the cast functions (CType, CStr, CBool, CInt, etc.) they
all work too! That's an excellent work Marco and Daniel!

<h3>1.7 MonoGLo: Other OpenGL binding</h3>

Sebastien Dedieu has wrote a C# binding for OpenGL (GL, GLU and glut)
based on Mono / Linux. You can get more info about it at the project
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/monoglo">site at sourceforge</a>.
Or you can visit it's <a
href="http://csgl.sourceforge.net/index.html">website</a>

<h3>1.8 Wx.NET</h3>

wx.NET is now on SourceForge. wx.NET is a .NET wrapper for wxWindows.
It is composed of two parts: wx-c is a C++ library which exposes the
wxWindows API as a collection of C# friendly C functions. wx.NET is a
.NET assembly written in C# which parallels the wxWindows class
hierarchy. You can find it <a
href="http://wxnet.sourceforge.net">here</a>. The developers have
added new event code, and Bryan Bulten has started working on a port
of the "Controls" sample.

<h3>1.9 libgnomeprint bindings started</h3>

Alejandro Sánchez has commited to CVS the firt code of the 
libgnomeprint binding for Mono. Still there is a lot of work to make to generate all the
metadata stuff and gets a nice XML file but now others members of the
Mono project can contribute to libgnomeprint. We expect to get
gnomeprint soon in Mono working.

<h3>1.10 PHP and Mono integrated</h3>

Sterling Hughes announced that PHP and Mono are now integrated! This
means you can access .NET assemblies from PHP. For more information
please see <a
href="http://www.php.net/~sterling/mono/">http://www.php.net/~sterling/mono/</a>.
So now you can do things as: 
<pre>
&lt;?php
$Console = new Mono('System.Console');
$Console->WriteLine('Welcome to the .NET World');
?>
</pre>

<h3>1.11 gtkhtml3 binaries for monodoc</h3>

Alp has made a CVS snapshot of libgtkhtml3 packaged for Debian at
<a href="http://www.atoker.com/mono/">http://www.atoker.com/mono/</a>
so people don't have to build it out of GNOME CVS themselves if they
want to try the doc browser

<h3>1.12 Late breaking news!</h3>

Jackson's produced the first Gtk# hello world application written in
IL with the Mono IL assembler. Take a look at <a href="http://www.leahandjackson.com/hello_world.png">it</a>.

<h3>2. Meet the team. This week Tim Coleman</h3>

	<p>The Mono team is integrated by contributors all over the world
	that are working really hard to get this project going
	further. In this section we will be meeting this people so we
	can know more about them and what they are doing.</p>	

	<p>This week we are proud to present Tim Coleman. Tim is a
	Canadian hacker who lives in Kitchener, Ontario (Canada) and
	works in Waterloo for <a href="http://www.opentext.com">Open
	Text</a> (one of the fist companies to index the web). He
	studied Computer Science and Combinatorics & Optimization
	at the University of Waterloo. He is involved with <a
	href="http://www.gnome-db.org">gnome-db</a> after he got
	started with Mono. He started out in Mono with some of the
	System.Xml namespaces. And he has been developing with
	databases ever since
	he started as a professional. Then his friends <a
	href="http://monoevo.sourceforge.net/mwn/archives/01102003.html">Daniel
	Morgan</a>, Rodrigo Moya and Gonzalo Paniagua convinced him to
	help them out. As he was the only one to successfully install
	oracle on Linux, he was the first to start working on a libgda
	oracle provider. He gets a life by writing custom code for
	lots of different clients as well as creating modules to do
	whatever you want to do with them. Some time ago he also
	develop code for WindowMaker but stopped working on it.  In
	his spare time he enjoys submiting patches for code if he
	finds useful, reading, doing puzzles, crosswords, a lot of
	mental stuff. "<i>I write code as a hobby too.  That's lots of fun.</i>"

	
<h4>Interview with Tim Coleman</h4>

This week we had a chance to meet Tim at #mono, let's see what he
told us.

        <p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span> You told us that
        some friends of you that form part of the Mono Team convinced
	you to come to Mono, is there any other reason?</p>
	
	<p class="answer"><span class="person">Tim Coleman:</span> The
	reason I came to Mono was that I was interested in learning
	more about web services. When I found that Mono didn't have
	that, I thought I would help in any way possible to bring Mono
	up-to-speed and then I just stayed around for the ride.</p>
	
        <p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span> You have
	been a free software developer for a long time, what do you
	think about the impact Mono will have in the free software
	community?</p>

	<p class="answer"><span class="person">Tim Coleman:</span>
	Well, I don't really know that it will have a huge impact on
	the free software community.  A lot of free software folks
	have a very negative view of Microsoft, and many of those
	people will wonder why they should use Mono instead of Java,
	which is not from Microsoft. I think it could lead to broader
	usage of more open operating systems, such as Linux or BSD,
	because software written for .NET will be able to run on those
	systems too.  I think that some managers will see the
	potential impact on their bottom line and at least look into
	using free software on their servers, more than they already
	do. The real impact will be on people outside of the free
	software community who aren't as anti-establishment as the
	hard-core open source advocates.</p>

	<p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span>  But
	some core developers will be bringing that open technologies
	to the UN*X environments, don't you think that will make those
	anti-establishment people to finally accept the tools Mono is
	providing?, that their position is more due to a lack of
	information about what Mono is? and so when they will get in
	touch with it they will accept it? In deed it's a community
	effort and not a Microsoft product.</p>

	<p class="answer"><span class="person">Tim Coleman</span> No,
	I don't really think that bringing the tool to other platforms
	will necessarily change people's opinions. At least, not over
	night. :-) A lot of people are very hesitant given Microsoft's
	track record, and they will always have doubts. I think that
	Mono will be associated with Microsoft for quite a while. You
	don't have to go any farther than Slashdot to discover that. I
	think that over time, people will start to use Mono on Linux
	and elsewhere, I just think that the motivation will come from
	outside of the free software community. And don't look for it
	to take the world by storm.</p>

	<p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span> Looking
	back in time we see that Mono has had a great development
	since it's beginning in a very short period. Which are the
	areas you have been contributing to this quick evolve since
	you joined the project and in which are you involved now?</p>

	<p class="answer"><span class="person">Tim Coleman:</span> All
	of my time in Mono has been spent in the class libraries. I
	started out, as I mentioned, interested in learning more about
	Web Services in .NET. I have quite a bit of experience in XML,
	so when I realized that there was no Web Services code in
	Mono, I started working on some of the System.Xml namespaces.
	That was last spring.  Then, I left Mono for a couple of
	months to work on an Oracle database provider for libgda. When
	I came back to Mono, I decided that it was time to start
	developing some of the Web Services namespaces. I had some
	help in there, and it was good for a while.  Along the way, I
	worked on some of the System.Xml.Serialization classes,
	because those are used by System.Web.Services. Then, I hit an
	impasse and I wasn't able to get around it. The great thing
	about Mono so far is that there is so much to do that when you
	hit a wall, you can just change your focus to an other area
	and come back. That's what I did -- I started working on the
	Mono SQL Server client provider, along with some help from
	Daniel Morgan, Gonzalo Paniagua and Rodrigo Moya. Just before
	Christmas I got very busy at work, so I have been away from
	Mono since then. I'm trying to get back into it. Just the
	other day I started working on some of the Oracle code that
	Daniel was working on, and I got it to compile on Linux. I
	think for the next little while I will be working on making
	that more complete. I will probably also be paying more
	attention to bugs that people email me about in the SQL
	Server/Sybase providers.</p>

	<p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span> How
	complete is the ADO.NET implementation then?</p>

        <p class="answer"><span class="person">Tim Coleman</span>
	Well, that's really hard to say.  At this point, I wouldn't
	even consider it for production use. I could make up a number,
	like 50%, and say it, but I don't think that would be very
	useful. Much of it is there and works. There are still lots of
	bugs to be found if you're looking for them, and that's what
	we really need right now. We need people with software that
	works on .NET to tell us what doesn't work on Mono. .NET isn't
	being accepted very quickly though, so I don't really think
	there is a large volume of code out there, and the number of
	people that have heard of Mono is relatively small, so we
	probably won't get that very soon. Of course, if you asked me,
	I would say to use the providers that I worked on, because
	they must be the best :-), but really, none of them are
	perfect, and none of them are ready for production use anyway,
	so use what you want and let us know about the bugs!</p>

	<p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span> Can you
	give us any advice then (despite that of using your
	providers ;-))?</p>

	<p class="answer"><span class="person">Tim Coleman:</span> I
	think if people choose what database to use based on which
	provider they think is most bug-free, then they are not making
	an appropriate decision.</p>

	<p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span> Could you
	say the final words of the interview?</p>

	<p class="answer"><span class="person">Tim Coleman:</span> I
	think that Mono is a truly exceptional project. I don't think
	I've talked to anyone on the team that wasn't friendly, or
	that wasn't interested in making Mono better. If we all work
	together, then we can all enjoy the fruits of our labour. We
	wouldn't be able to make this happen without each other.</p>

<h3>3. Mailing List Activity</h3>

We have more mailing lists! Take a look at: <a
href="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/">http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/</a>.
Visit the <a href="http://www.go-mono.org/mailing-lists.html">list</a>
of available ones.

   The main points:
   <ul>
     <li>Sterling Hughes sent an small patch which defines
   mono_load_image to mono_image_open as mono_load_image is
   no longer present within the mono library.</li>
     <li>Alejandro Sánchez Acosta started on some GnomePrint#
     bindings in gtk#. Cesar Octavio Lopez Nataren is helping
     with that too. Daniel Morgan said "once GnomePrint# can
     work, I wonder if we could get it to work with the
     System.Drawing.Printing namespace - especially
     PrintDocument", in reply to a guy that was asking for
     printing libraries in Mono.</li>
     <li>Sebastien Poulliot sent this: "I just commited a first
     version of Mono.Security.Win32 assembly in CVS. As it's name
     indicates this assembly is for Win32 only. It's goal is to
     permit the use of CryptoAPI under Windows for enhanced
     compatibility (like keypair persistance) and performance
     (like using a crypto accelerator - HSM). A more complete
     description is available at
     <a href="http://www.go-mono.org/crypto.html">http://www.go-mono.org/crypto.html</a>.
     Just a remainder: This assembly is NOT meant to be linked directly
     with any application. It's usage should be transparent
     to application that use (directly or not) the CryptoConfig class
     to create the cryptographic algorithms. So far the following
     CryptoAPI algorithm are supported:
      <ul><li>random number generator (selectable using CspParameters)</li>
          <li>hash algorithms (MD2, MD4, MD5 and SHA1);</li>
      </ul>
     </li>
     <li>Rodrigo Moya: <i>"gnome-db is obsolete. Make sure to not
     install it :-) libgda/libgnomedb/mergeant replace it."</i>
     </li>
     
     </ul>
