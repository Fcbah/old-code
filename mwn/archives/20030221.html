<h3>1.1 New assemblies in the Mono CVS</h3>

Mono now distributes a few new assemblies: Mono.Security.Win32 as a
layer to use the cryptographic functionality on Win32. The Mono.Posix
assembly which contains functionality for taking advantage of Unix
facilities.

<h3>1.2 Authenticode and more</h3>

Mono development is moving quickly: Tim and Daniel have been
improving the Oracle database provider and Sebastien Pouliot has got
code signing to work using Authenticode with pure open source and
managed code. Plenty of new VB.NET work from Marco (compiler) and
Daniel (runtime). Also Jackson has resumed work on the IL assembler
and the fully managed library to generate CIL images (Sergey wrote
the first Mono.PEToolkit).

<h3>1.3 Polish site</h3>

Poland Mono friends have opened a Mono site to which you are all
welcome: <a href="http://www.go-mono.pl">http://www.go-mono.pl</a>

<h3>1.4 OpenGL# bindings for Mono</h3>

Mark Crichton has completed his OpenGL/GLUT bindings for Gnome. A
screenshot can be seen <a
href="http://www.go-mono.org/sshots/oglcs.png">here</a>. The bindings
are available on the Mono CVS repository on the module `glgen'. This
is a straight binding to the C API.

<h3>1.5 Mono Basic updates</h3>

Marco has <a
href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2003-February/011752.html">posted</a>
an update on the current state of the free VB.NET compiler for Mono.

<h3>1.6 Volunteers to document Gtk#</h3>

Miguel posted: <i>"With the availability of a documentation browser,
we are looking for volunteers to help us complete the documentation of
the Gtk# binding for Mono. Experience with Gtk is useful, but not
mandatory. We have checked in stubs, and we have instructions, and
resources to how to complete this process here. Mail the
<a
href="mailto:mono-docs-list@ximian.com">mono-docs-list@ximian.com</a>
for further discussion"</i>

<h3>1.7 Mono talks</h3>

If you live close to Florence, Italy, you could have a chance to see
Paolo Molaro, one of the Mono architects do a talk on the Mono project,
and cover various aspects of the technology. This talk is on Saturday
at the GUADIC conference (the Italian conference for GNOME users and
developers). More details about this can be found <a
href="http://www.it.gnome.org/GUADIC/">here</a>. Gonzalo Paniagua,
core Mono developer (responsible for ASP.NET in Mono) is doing a talk
on Thursday in Badajoz, Spain. Details are <a
href="http://www.gulex.org/actividades.htm">here</a>  


<h3>2. Meet the team. This week Johannes Roith</h3>

	<p>The Mono team is integrated by contributors all over the world
	that are working really hard to get this project going
	further. In this section we will be meeting this people so we
	can know more about them and what they are doing.</p>	

	<p>Johannes Roith is a 17 old monoer from Cham (Bavaria),
	Germany who is attending to classes at the German
	Gymnasium. He enjoys listening to Rap, Oasis and The Beatles
	and watching Star Wars, Lord of the Rings and James Bond ones
	in special. He likes Italian, Bavarian and Greek food and he
	is preparing a trip to Italy in the next two weeks. In his
	free time hi likes to go skiing and snowboarding.
		
	
<h4>Interview with Johannes </h4>

This week we had a chance to meet Johannes at #mono, let's see what he
told us.

        <p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span> Have you
	ever been involved with the OpenSource movement before you
	joined the Mono Project?</p>
	
	<p class="answer"><span class="person">Johannes Roith:</span>
	Not actively. I tracked Slashdot, had Linux installed, but I
	did not contribute. Except maybe bug reports for Mozilla and
	some sf.net projects. I can't remember. I just report if I
	found one.
	</p>

	<p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span> Do you
	have any programming background then?</p>

	<p class="answer"><span class="person">Johannes Roith:</span>
	I've programmed as a hobbyist and for some local projects. I
	started with Pascal and PHP as well as Java.</p>

	<p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span> Why did
	you come to Mono?</p>

	<p class="answer"><span class="person">Johannes Roith:</span>
	When MS announced .NET, I was interested immediately. I
	downloaded some beta and started using it. However I quickly
	felt locked into windows, as all other languages I've used before
	were multi-platform, and I could use them on my Linux box as
	well. When I heard about Mono, I was even more excited,
	because this solved my little problem. As many people of the
	team also are Gnome developers I started to also track Gnome
	development and started programming for GNOME. So the
	multi-platform thing is not the primary concern, why I'm at
	mono, now. But it was the reason I joined. Also Mono and the
	Mono team make it very easy to help out, as their is plenty of
	stuff to do, and they help you to get started with something quickly.
        So I took the chance to contribute some bits to OpenSource.
	</p>

	<p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span> You are
	the one that started the MonkeyGuide, don't you?</p>

	<p class="answer"><span class="person">Johannes Roith:</span>
	Yes. I had contributed some bits to the Gnome.NET tutorial,
	first. Later I wrote something about ADO.NET and ASP.NET and
	collected it in "MonkeyGuide". When I saw there was much
	interest in it, I've extended the document, and it covers now
        almost anything from installation to learning C#, programming
	with Gnome, ADO.NET, ASP.NET, but there is still plenty of
	stuff to do.</p>

	<p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span> It was
	been shown that one of the problems with GNOME was the lack of
	a good set of documentation since it's beginning. Devhelp,
	ggad... they all helped but it's not enough. What do you think
	about the Mono documentation how is it planned?.</p>

	<p class="answer"><span class="person">Johannes Roith:</span>
	<i>Good documentation can save many hours of frustration</i>
	When "The Mono Handbook", thats the new name for MonkeyGuide
	is finished I'll start working on the Gtk# documentation.</p>

	<p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span> As the
	monodoc browser is there are you planning to move the
	MonkeyGuide to monodoc format so it can be integrated in
	monodoc browser?</p>

	<p class="answer"><span class="person">Johannes Roith:</span>
	It turned out that this is pretty easy and straight forward,
	as the monodoc browser uses gtkhtml to render the docs.
	MonkeyGuide is HTML, with CSS stylesheets, so it takes just a
	few minutes to change some styles for better integration.
	Theoretically it should work in it's current form in the
	browser, but for consistency some design changes may be needed.
	So it will integrate perfectly without changing anything in
	the HTML files. It will be in definitely.</p>

        <p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span> Since a
	lot of documentation can be reused from the MS documentation,
	will the priority go to the Mono specific modules?</p>

	<p class="answer"><span class="person">Johannes Roith:</span> 
	Yes, Gtk# and the Mono.* namespaces are a priority, but we
	must be carefully not to break copyright from MS. That's why
	the other bits need work as well, although currently people
	can use the on-line documentation from Microsoft.</p>
	
	<p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span> About the
	documentation of Gtk# and GNOME which are the next widgets you
	think should be first documented? Is there any order you are
	following or do you have any way people can ask for it?</p>

	<p class="answer"><span class="person">Johannes Roith:</span>
	I simply start with the widgets used most often and the ones
	useful for a step-by-step tutorial.</p>

	<p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span>.NET
	Metadata is full of 'documentation' is it being used in order
	to get documentation in an automatic way or do you have to get
	it all by hand.</p>

	<p class="answer"><span class="person">Johannes Roith:</span>
	The monodoc XML format does create stub docs automatically,
	but the rest has to be done by hand. It's more about
	describing and eventually giving examples.</p>

	<p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span> Is there
	anything left you want to say to the Mono World?</p>

	<p class="answer"><span class="person">Johannes Roith:</span>
	I think Mono is really different from other projects, not only
	because of the great technology itself, but also the nice and
	friendly people working on it. A big thanks to all the other
	hackers working on it!</p>


	
<!-- <h3>3. Mono Socials: </h3> -->


<h3>3. Mailing List Activity</h3>

   The main points this week were:
   <ul>
   <li>Lots of senseless flame about the patents issue. We don't
   want to make more echo about that so please refer to the
   <a href="http://www.go-mono.org/faq.html">Mono FAQ</a> for the
   solution.
   <li>Some people seems to be interested in the scripting in .NET.
   If you are one of those <a
   href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2003-February/012123.html">here</a>
   you have an email you might want to read.</li>
   <li>Miguel wrote an <a
   href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2003-February/012241.html">interesting
   email</a> about some runtime internals.</li>     
     </ul>
