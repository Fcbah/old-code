<h3>1.1 Mono 0.23 released</h3>

<p>  Mono 0.23 has been released. It is only a bug fix release.
     You can read the release notes <a
     href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/mono-0.23">here</a>.
</p>

<h3>1.2 System.Web.Mail + UUEnconding</h3>

<p> Per Arneng added UUEncoding to System.Web.Mail for attachment
    encoding. So now both of the encoding techniques work for
    attachments UUEncode, Base64. Soon the mail API will be totally
    completed since there are only some minor parts left to fix. 
</p>

<h3>1.3 XML Deserialization now in the CVS</h3>

<p> Miguel has applied Elan Feingold's XML Deserialization support
    patch to the CVS. Now objects serialized using XML format can
    be deserialized back. 
</p>

<h3>1.4 CORBA support is closer</h3>

<p> Kristopher Johnson has <a
    href="http://kristopherjohnson.net/kj/RemotingDotCorba">published</a>
    his code for CORBA support. As you can read at his website:
    "<i>Remoting.Corba is a personal project that aims to integrate
    CORBA/IIOP support into the .NET Remoting architecture. The goal
    is to allow .NET programmers to easily develop systems that
    interoperate with CORBA systems</i>".
</p>

<h3>2. Meet the team. This week Alp Toker</h3>

	<p>The Mono team is integrated by contributors all around the world
	that are working really hard to get this project going
	further. In this section we will be meeting this people so we
	can know more about them and what they are doing.</p>	

	<p><a href="http://www.atoker.com">Alp Toker</a> is a 6th
	former based in Highgate, North London, studying Maths,
	Physics and German. He has been working with Free Software
	in his spare time for several years, and got involved with
	development on Linux a few years ago when he wrote gPal, a
	small Gtk+ frontend for the PayPal online payment service.
	After releasing the first version, there were many requests
	for packages and thus began his involvement with Debian and
	GNOME. He is editor of the popular <a
	href="http://www.debianplanet.org">DebianPlanet</a> site,
	and one of his projects today is the packaging of <a
	href="http://www.debianplanet.org/mono/">Mono for Debian</a>.
	For I while, He was part of the <a
	href="http://www.gnomemeeting.org">GnomeMeeting</a> developer
	team. This is where he learnt the dynamics of working with
	larger code bases and a distributed development team. At the
	FOSDEM 2002 conference, he had a lengthy discussion with
	Miguel de Icaza on the merits of Mono, after which he decided
	this was a project which could benefit him and vice versa.
	<i>"My main desire was to have a truly free alternative to Java
	by the time he reached university. Mono, based on ECMA
	standards, promised to fulfil that goal. Now, a year on, it
	seems well on course to do so"</i>, Alp states.</p>

	<p>Most of his time is shared between studies, reading books
	with unfeasibly long titles and hacking code. At other times,
	you're likely to find him down at the local, or if it's a
	Saturday night, trekking through the City with mates. He
	craves trance music right now, though he'd be hard-pressed to
	name favourites; <i>"any tune that doesn't involve "blastin' holes
	in gangstas" is fair game, really"</i>, says. Sometimes, he tries his
	hand at cooking, often with limited success. Having pretty much
	conquered elementary Chinese dishes like lemon chicken, egg
	fried rice and eggdrop soup, he's now looking towards Japanese
	and Turkish cuisine. <i>"They say cooking impresses the girls,
	but I'm not sure mine would"</i>.
	</p>
	
<h4>Interview with Alp</h4>

This week we had a chance to meet Alp at #mono, let's see what he
told us.

        <p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span> You are
	the developer of maybe two of the best and very first mono
	based applications, <a
	href="http://www.atoker.com/acacia/">Acacia</a>
	(the new name for <a
	href="http://www.atoker.com/gsirc/">gsIRC</a>)
	and <a href="http://www.atoker.com/platano/">Platano</a>.
	Can you tell us a little bit about them? What moved you
	towards their development? </p>
	
	<p class="answer"><span class="person">Alp Toker:</span>
	That's very flattering of you; I'd say they're definitely both
	works in progress at the moment. <a
	href="http://www.atoker.com/platano/">Platano media player</a>
	is a fairly simple affair based on the GStreamer multimedia
	framework, now part of the GNOME platform. It was intended as
	a proof of concept for Gst#, the CLI binding for GStreamer,
	and still only plays simple video files. The development of
	Gst# wasn't as challenging as it might at first sound, be use
	it's mostly auto-generated by the fantastic Gtk# GAPI code
	parser and generator, which only needed a few modifications
	to cope with the new code-base. However, it's received a very
	positive response from the community, and it's interesting to
	note that a simple video hack (complete with cutesy banana
	logo) can woo people who wouldn't understand or be interested
	in a fantastic new optimisation in the runtime, or a complete
	Remoting implementation. <b>It's all about reaching different
	target audiences</b>. Acacia (formerly gsirc), an IRC client, is
	a slightly more complex application. Its development has been
	a rewarding experience as there's a lot of interest in
	Gtk+/GNOME 2 IRC clients, meaning there are always users eager
	to find bugs and provide suggestions as well as developers to
	provide patches. I'm getting the chance to do things the way I
	think they should be in an IRC client, and the ease of C# code
	means I can afford to spend more time in the "sugar" like
	custom widgets that make for a more complete user experience.
	Once again, it makes extensive use of existing technologies:
	<b>Acacia uses Thresher, an excellent IRC library for .NET. It's
	interesting to note that the author released his (X11
	licensed) code only with Microsoft's .NET implementation in
	mind, yet it runs today on Mono without modification</b>. My
	main motivation in writing these programs was to test Mono and
	Gtk# with real-world applications. The most important form of
	testing by far is provided by unit tests, and Mono has a very
	comprehensive test suite, but sometimes  bugs can slip past
	it and only trigger problems in real situations. Best of all,
	I've had the opportunity to get quite intimate with the inner
	workings of Gtk#, which I'm now doing API beautification for.
	Most recently, I committed a patch to the GAPI generator that
	eliminates the need for length parameters for strings, a piece
	of legacy from the C world that C# doesn't need to carry.</p>

	<p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span> And how
	do you feel about Mono as an experienced Linux developer? Do
	you think Gtk# can become a serious competitor to the classic
	GTK+/Gtk--?</p>

	<p class="answer"><span class="person">Alp Toker:</span>
	<i>Miguel once said, "<b>There is a point in your life when you
	realize that you have written enough destructors, and have
	spent enough time tracking down a memory leak, and you have
	spend enough time tracking down memory corruption, and you
	have spent enough time using low-level insecure functions,
	and you have implemented way too many linked lists</b>"</i>. This
	pretty much echoes my sentiments. I've worked with  commercial
	and Free Software code for data analysis, kernel sources and
	Web applications, so I recognise that the diversity of
	programming languages is vital to the developer community. I
	still have love for the arcane delights of Perl and the
	structured, clean form of Python, <i>but to me C# is a step-up
	for large desktop and Web applications. Whether Gtk# will hit
	it off with wider (read Windows) developer community is
	anyone's guess, but the Gtk# team is working hard to provide
	an API that is consistent and compatible with best practice
	on the .NET platform. Even certain core Gtk+ developers
	believe that C is not suitable for applications programming,
	but rather for lower-level systems and libraries, so there
	is definitely a market for higher-level languages and
	platforms that make life easier for developers and us.
	</p>

	<p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span> You said
	you beautifying Gtk# at the API. Taking in consideration that
	GTK+ was quite hard to use for primer and medium C programmers,
	how faithful will you be to GTK+. Do you think it could be
	better not to respect the GTK+ API and instead make something
	closer to Swing or Windows.Forms?</p>

	<p class="answer"><span class="person">Alp Toker:</span> Swing
	and System.Windows.Forms both have their merits. Swing
	represents the culmination of much research and effort into
	providing an API that integrates with the Java object model.
	Similarly, SWF integrates tightly with the Windows
	environment, providing users as well as developers with an
	instantly recognisable interface. Gtk+ comes from a different
	heritage, mostly derived from older UNIX toolkits like Motif.
	That's not to say that the Gtk+ way of doing things is any
	less valid than the others, but it does sometimes need a
	different frame of thought that comes more easily to X11
	developers. That said, <b>the tweaks being done on Gtk# should
	make the API feel more familiar to Forms developers without
	alienating long-time Gtk+ developers. Gtk# is definitely
	progressive, but perhaps more evolutionary than
	revolutionary</b>.

	<p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span> One of
	the core points of implementing .NET is that we have a bunch
	of documentation provided by Microsoft and all the editorials
	that have focused their attention in .NET. But as Gtk# is
	not a .NET element what are the plans about it's
	documentation? Is it going to be Monodoc based or we can
	expect more training facilities?</p>

	<p class="question"><span class="person">Alp Toker:</span>
	There are two issues at hand here. First is the systematic
	documentation of Gtk# interfaces -- there's currently a
	massive effort under way to document the API from scratch, in
	the style of other .NET documentation. <b>The idea is to leave
	behind any trace of legacy C terminology in favour of a fresh
	new set of documentation</b>. The response has been so great
	that even undocumented areas of Gtk+ are now having their Gtk#
	counterparts documented. As API beautification continues, a
	new set of independent documentation for Gtk# will become
	ever more important. The other issue is tutorial-style
	documentation for newcomers. <i>The <a
	href="http://www.go-mono.org/tutorial/">Mono Handbook</a>,
	spearheaded by Johannes Roith and Martin Willemoes Hansen not
	only provides introductions to the various technologies that
	comprise Mono, but also has a breathtaking compendium of
	carefully commented code snippets, categorised by namespace,
	that teach by example</i>. More tutorials will undoubtedly start
	to appear on third party sites as Mono becomes more
	widely-distributed. Right now, Gtk+ 2 doesn't integrate into
	the Windows environment as well as it should. The Windows port
	of Gtk+ has a shallow look and feel that can leave a bad
	impression with Windows users. However, commercial
	applications from the likes of Macromedia and Adobe, as well
	as Mozilla have proved that it is possible to have a
	non-native toolkit that is sturdy and consistent with the
	Windows UI. Work is being done to provide a native-widget
	rendering theme engine for Gtk+. More customisations may be
	needed to provide even smaller tweaks, like ensuring that
	the contents of a scrolled widget are attached full-bleed to
	their respective scrollbar widgets. This is one of the tasks
	that I believe will get a lot of attention once the code Gtk#
	API has settled down. <i>The Gtk+ approach still makes more sense
	for cross-platform development than often-discussed lowest
	common denominator approaches, when a toolkit provides only
	the functionality that's available on both platforms</i>. With
	that addressed, there will be little technical reason not to
	go with Gtk# for cross-platform development. The stigma
	associated with using an API outside the bounds of the System
	namespace for fundamental UI functionality may be more
	difficult to overcome.</p>

	<p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span> Do you
	know if people at ICSharpCode is planning Gtk# support for
	CSharpDevelop?</p>

	<p class="answer"><span class="person">Alp Toker:</span> I
	don't know much about what the SharpDevelop people are up
	to, except that they have an experimental Java-to-C# port
	of SWT used by the Eclipse IDE. This would provide a user
	interface based on Gtk+ when run on Linux, although if I
	understand correctly, it would be independent of Gtk#. I
	haven't heard of any plans to introduce a Gtk# UI designer
	for SharpDevelop.</p>

	<p class="question"><span class="person">MWN:</span> Is there
	anything else you want to say to the Mono community that will
	be reading this?</p>

	<p class="answer"><span class="person">Alp Toker:</span> <i>One
	of the most fascinating things about the Mono project is that
	it operates in a kind of common ground of platforms, acting
	as a hub for users and developers coming from vastly differing
	backgrounds and occupations</i>. It might be a matter of
	discussing the merits of Mono with people who start an abusive
	thread on the mailing list out of spite or misinformation.
	At other times, it's as simple as not putting down someone
	who accidentally commits MS-DOS style linefeeds to CVS with
	their first commit. I couldn't have anticipated the maturity
	of the developer team in handling the varying opinions and
	approaches, which these people bring. Thanks also for your
	great work with Mono Weekly News, Jaime.</p>

     
<h3>2. Mailing List Activity</h3>

  These days the mailing list has been quiet and despite some
  'suspicious' drops, there were no trolls in the scene.
  Let's see the most important points discussed.

  <ul>
    <li>
      Rafael D Teixeira posted a bunch of interesting links
      to articles on .NET Remoting and Security issues.
      Copying from directly from his mail:

      <table border=1>
        <tr>
	  <td>
	    <a
	    href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dndotnet/html/remsspi.asp">.NET

	  </td>
	  <td>

	    Microsoft.Samples.Runtime.Remoting.Security Assembly</a>
	  </td>
	</tr>
      </table>
    </li>
    <li>
      Paolo Molaro pointed out these facts in his reply to an email
      about benchmarks between Mono and MS .NET SDK. About the
      JITers: <i>mcs inserts useless additional variables with the pre/post
      increment/decrement operators, and that makes the jit produce
      somewhat worse code, there is already a bug filed for that.</i>
      And about the index_string_test points: <i>We already discussed in
      the past about storing the calculated hashvalue for strings:
      that may help somewhat. Serge measured our Hashtable implementation
      using the MS runtime and the speed was comparable to their
      implementation. The other issue is memory allocation: in the
      tests a lot of boxing operations take place, I have a simple
      patch that speeds up both index_test and index_string_test by
      about 10%, though it can be improved</i>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Daniel Morgan wrote a wonderful summary about how to choose the
      best database for your application. If you plan to develop Mono
      based applications using databases, read <a
      href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2003-March/012867.html">this</a>
       and then go ahead!.
    </li>
    <li>
      Fegus Henderson wrote a nice reply for the <i>lies and
      micro benchmarks</i>. What he states is something to keep on mind
      and to think about when taking the speed at runtime the only
      parameter to measure how powerful a language (and the framework
      behind it) is.
    </li>
    <li>
      CORBA support is closer as we can read in this 
      <a
      href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2003-March/012974.html">email</a>.
      We are very happy of seeing this, specially all of us that have
      dig into how to get that done and that want to have Mono fully
      integrated with <a href="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME Desktop</a> 
    </li>
  </ul>
