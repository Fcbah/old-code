**** 0. How to edit entries while using the ripper?

You can't edit entries from the ripper itself. This might sound very 
strange but it was a design decission (we can change it if we have 
good reasons to do it, as we want to and we have the time to do it ;-)).
Instead of that, we preffer you to edit the news item (.mwnitem file) 
and reload the entries. This is proved to be much less error prone.

**** 1. How do I create a modules.list file for MonoCvsSpy?

In order to generate the modules list, enter the following command in the mcs/class directory:

for i in `ls`; do echo $i | grep -v README | grep -v PEAPI | grep -v LICENSE | grep -v CVS | grep -v ChangeLog | grep -v lib | grep -v Makefile | grep -v notes; done > modules.list

Then you should add '/' to the end of each line that appears several times.
In particular, add it to 'System' and 'doc'.

The modules.list file should be moved to the directory where 
the monocvsspy.exe file is.
